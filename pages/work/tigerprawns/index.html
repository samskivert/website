<p>Our web application development environment has been slowly evolving
over the course of a number of years. In this time, we have identified
and added a number of very useful features, but the organic growth of the
system is starting to catch up with us. This combined with some new large
scale requirements (like co-branding and internationalization support)
have provided the motivation to design a next generation system. The new
system will build upon the good ideas we've had in the past and incorporate
useful new functionality and do it all in a (hopefully) cleaner and more
organized way.
<p>With that in mind, I have undertaken to describe the requirements for
this new system, both as a reference point for their discussion and refinement
and as a starting point for the system design. I have code named this system
Tigerprawns in homage to the <i>original</i> Go2Net site which lived in
<tt>/export/docs/tigerprawns</tt>.
<p>Without further ado, the requirements:
<h3>
Design requirements</h3>
These are not features, per se, but guidelines to follow when designing
and implementing the system.
<h4>
<font color="#009900">Low connectedness</font></h4>
<font color="#009900">As much as possible, each of these components should
not interdepend. Certain components will of necessity make use of other
components, but this should be well thought out when it is done. Keeping
the components as self-contained as possible will make them easier to understand
and maintain and it will allow developers using the system to choose which
components they wish to incorporate into their application. Certainly we
hope they will choose to include them all, but we shouldn't require that
by messy interconnectedness of the components.</font>
<h4>
<font color="#009900">Non-Go2Net specific</font></h4>
<font color="#009900">Much Go2Net specific code has crept into our existing
system because it is generally much quicker and easier to add a hack in
a base class to accomplish some simple system specific thing than it is
to design extensible, reusable support for doing what that hack needed
to accomplish. There will be plenty of pressure to add such hacks once
the system is deployed to all of our sites, so we should adamantly avoid
such hacks in the design and initial implementation, instead creating frameworks
to accomplish all of the hackery that we've indulged in up to this point.</font>
<p><font color="#009900">We need to be conscious of the difference between
Tigerprawns and applications developed using Tigerprawns and make sure
they don't begin to overlap.</font>
<h4>
<font color="#009900">Standards based</font></h4>
<font color="#009900">Where possible, the components should be based on
standard technologies. In addition to this obvious requirement, we should
also make sure that we don't over-standardize (here comes the pitch). There
are emerging standards that may or may not satisfy our requirements and
jumping on board a standard too soon can be just as problematic as not
jumping on board at all. By adhering to the principle of modularity in
the design and implementation of the system, we will leave ourselves the
flexibility to change individual components over to standards based technologies
when the standards have matured and are a clear benefit.</font>
<h4>
Java servlet based</h4>
The system may or may not depend on Apache/JServ, preferably not. Preferably
it will only depend on a compliant servlet implementation. We may want
to make implicit assumptions like the availability of <tt>&lt;!--#include--></tt>
post-processing.
<h3>
Feature requirements</h3>
These requirements describe specific functionality and features that should
be provided by the system.
<h4>
Automatic recompilation and reloading of servlets</h4>
JSP provides this technology and may be the way to go. However, JSP also
provides a whole host of wrong ways to do things in addition to providing
automatic servlet compilation and reloading, so we may want to extract
or wrap only that particular part of JSP.
<h4>
Co-brand support</h4>
The system should be structured such that it is as easy as possible to
support multiple interfaces to a particular set of functionality. We provide
differently branded versions of our services both to other companies as
well as between our own services.
<h4>
Internationalization support</h4>
While we don't currently support foreign language versions of our software,
it is high on everyone's list. The system should extend the support Java
provides for internationalization to make it easy to localize the dynamic
parts of our applications as well as provide a framework for managing translated
versions of our static content.
<h4>
<font color="#009900">Support for multiple target devices</font></h4>
<font color="#009900">Currently (for the most part) our users all access
our content via a web browser running on a PC or something that approximates
that set up. We will soon wish to provide support in some way or other
to wireless devices as well as broadband/set-top box devices and potentially
others. The system should facilitate as much as possible the deployment
of our dynamic and static content in different forms, some of which may
not be based on HTML.</font>
<h4>
Template language</h4>
Dynamically retrieved information must be combined with static content
and page layout information and served to the user. The system by which
this is accomplished should have the following characteristics:
<ul>
<li>
as complete a separation of HTML and code as possible</li>

<li>
a simple interface for simple tasks; simply placing the current time on
a page should not require a tremendous amount of code</li>

<li>
a more robust interface for more sophisticated tasks; every time a stock
quote is displayed, the code for formatting the change should not be repeated</li>

<li>
the system should work with non-HTML templates as well as HTML templates;
we will want to reuse it for things like email generation</li>
</ul>
Presently, much thought is going into whether or not this template system
should be based on XSL. I'll stay out of that discussion here and just
try to identify the requirements without biasing them toward one implementation
or another.
<h4>
Framework for authentication</h4>
Many of our sites support registered users and differing levels of service.
We need to provide an extensible authentication framework by which these
needs can easily be met.
<ul>
<li>
manage credentials in a cookie</li>

<li>
simple interface for a servlet to require a particular credential or set
of credentials (and automatic handling of authentication or reporting on
lack of authorization)</li>

<li>
specific credentials to be assigned on a per-user basis: token-based division
of access, role-based grouping of tokens for easy classification of users</li>

<li>
pluggable back end for authentication (LDAP, Oracle database, etc.)</li>

<li>
management tools for customer support</li>

<li>
an interface into the billing system so that credentials can depend on
payment; avoid tight integration with the billing system here and instead
provide interfaces that can be implemented to use our billing system of
choice</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Form handling library</h4>
Managing data entry in our applications in a consistent and sensible manner
is critical. The number of sites on the web that display an error message
and send you back to a blank form, requiring you to fill everything out
again because you made some simple error is enough to turn the stomach.
We want to do everything we can to simplify the process of information
entry and validation both for the end user and the developer. Our form
handling services should support:
<ul>
<li>
required fields</li>

<li>
field validation</li>

<li>
a framework for the implementation of parsers for complicated data types</li>

<li>
field by field error reporting</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Database repository management</h4>

<ul>
<li>
unified interface to inhomogenous databases</li>

<li>
built on JDBC</li>

<li>
database connection pooling</li>

<li>
database error management and recovery</li>

<li>
provide support for things like SQL/J</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Logging, error tracking framework</h4>
A comprehensive logging framework allows for better debugging during development
and once a product is deployed. The system should provide:
<ul>
<li>
different log levels</li>

<li>
nightly filtering and mailing of log messages above a certain level</li>

<li>
servlet exception management: mail exceptions and failure notifications
generated by a servlet to the servlet's author</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Email generation</h4>
Many of our services generate email either periodically or as a result
of a user action (like registration). A developer should be able to easily
substitute some information into a template file and send an email.&nbsp;
This should be available from within a servlet and from a batch process.
<ul>
<li>
mechanism for using the template system to generate email messages</li>

<li>
simple one-shot mail delivery (registration acknowledgment, password reminder,
etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Performance analysis</h4>
We need at least simple servlet execution time analysis and a stress testing
framework. More sophisticated performance monitoring would be a bonus.
<h4>
Customization/preferences management</h4>
Many of our sites support customization or less buzz-wordily, allow the
user to persistently change the way our web applications work. This customization
support has so far been handled on a case-by-case basis. The system should
provide a flexible service for the storage of customizations on a per-user,
per-site and perhaps even per-feature basis. Requirements include:
<ul>
<li>
per-user, per-site, per-feature customizations</li>

<li>
caching of commonly referenced customizations in a cookie to avoid constant
database lookups</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Utility stuff</h4>
This stuff is part of the current system and should probably be incorporated
into the new system in the form of utility classes.
<ul>
<li>
generic cookie management routines</li>

<li>
general purpose data structure stuff like queues and sorting services</li>

<li>
synchronization management stuff like monitored threads, semaphores, etc.</li>

<li>
MD5 hashing routines</li>

<li>
regular expression services</li>
</ul>

with links to design documents for the various components.
