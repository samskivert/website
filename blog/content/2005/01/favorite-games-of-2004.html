  <p>The games I enjoyed playing most this year (in some vague order of enjoyment quotient):</p>
<ul>
<li> Pikmin 2 &#8211; GC</li>
<li> Paper Mario &#8211; GC</li>
<li> 塊魂 [Katamari Damacy] &#8211; PS2</li>
<li> Sly 2 &#8211; PS2</li>
<li> Hot Shots Golf: Fore! &#8211; PS2</li>
</ul>
<p>I also played a few wacky indy games that I really enjoyed:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://analogik.com/mm_rev_samorost.asp">Samorost</a> &#8211; Flash</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.loomsoft.net/games_zeps_dreamland.shtml">Zep&#8217;s Dreamland</a> &#8211; Vinders</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.harveycartel.org/metanet/n.html">N</a> &#8211; Flash
</li>
</ul>
<p>As I generally don&#8217;t review games that I don&#8217;t finish, it may be hard to gauge what I played based on my somewhat sporadic review output. For balance, here are some games I played that I didn&#8217;t much like:</p>
<ul>
<li>La Pucelle Tactics &#8211; I prefer strategy games where a small number of units and actual strategy take precedent over a zillion different item and unit combinations.</p>
<li> Half-Life 2 &#8211; I don&#8217;t like shooting things and books are a better medium for stories.</li>
<li> Metal Gear Solid 3 &#8211; See above, but replace books with movies and stories with overacted action plots.</li>
<li> Metroid Prime 2 &#8211; I got tired of waiting for the &#8220;Scanning&#8230;&#8221; display and of falling off platforms due to the first person perspective, and I don&#8217;t really like shooting things.</li>
<li> GTA3 &#8211; The driving interface was fiddly and standing in front of a wall and pressing a button to spray graffiti wasn&#8217;t a lot of fun. I have enough time worrying about eating cheese burgers and exercise in real life, if I have to do it in a game too, it damned well better add fun gameplay. Moreover, I&#8217;m sure if I got further into it, I would have been reminded that I don&#8217;t like shooting things.</li>
<li> Pitfall: The Lost Expedition &#8211; The worst execution I&#8217;ve seen in a long time; I&#8217;m not even sure the game was finished before they shipped it.</li>
<li> Transformers &#8211; Driving wasn&#8217;t that fun and did I mention that I don&#8217;t like shooting things.</li>
<li> Perimiter &#8211; An inscrutable RTS.</li>
<li> Evil Genius &#8211; Had some promise style-wise, but in the end the simulation gameplay failed to be compelling or fluid.</li>
<li> Leisure Suit Larry Magna Cum Laude &#8211; Gag me with a spoon, is this a game?</li>
<li> Burnout 3 &#8211; Oh God, the load times, my eyes, they burn. Maybe if I had a fun GBA game to play while I was waiting for the level to reload, I could have enjoyed it.</li>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And a number of games were alright, but not worth writing home about, as they say. The best part about 2004 was that thanks to Gamefly, I didn&#8217;t have to waste hundreds of dollars on tens of games that I didn&#8217;t enjoy. Yay for the consumer. Here&#8217;s hoping 2005 will provide more reasons to actually cough up the full price.</p>
