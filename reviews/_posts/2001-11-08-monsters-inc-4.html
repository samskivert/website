  <p>An absolutely delightful movie. Pixar continues to hit them out of the park with <cite>Monsters, Inc.</cite>, a riotously funny, tender, exciting and technically impressive film. Animation prowess aside, Pixar manages to make such great films that I wonder how other studios can screw up so badly. The writing and humor are top notch, the drama never contrived, the timing impeccable. They&#8217;ve got some great filmmakers tucked away over in Emeryville.</p>
