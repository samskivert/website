<p>I have enjoyed Jarmusch films in the past and I have thoroughly enjoyed Bill Murray films in the past. Unfortunately, the chocolate and peanut butter strategy didn’t work for me in this case. I thought the writing was pretty weak and Bill Murray’s supposed “Academy Award deserving” performance was just his same old shtick with a bit more asshole plus contemplative midlife crisis added into the mix.</p>
