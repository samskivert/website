  <p>I originally heard about this movie when two or three people separately reported that they were reminded of me by Jim Carrey&#8217;s character. I can only assume they were referring to the segments of warped memory land when he was pre-pubescent and hiding under the kitchen table. Vanity aside, it was strangely romantic, strangely similar to the other Charlie Kaufman film I&#8217;ve seen and just plain strange.</p>
