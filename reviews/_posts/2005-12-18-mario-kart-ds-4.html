  <p>Pure unadulterated racing antics. I&#8217;m glad to see the controls return to a more N64-style, I wasn&#8217;t a big fan of the GBA or GC controls. Bringing back tracks from previous Karts is brilliant. The few new items are well conceived, local area wireless play rocks the house, Internet play is a nice bonus. It is all around juicy goodness.</p>
