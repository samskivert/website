  <p>The book covers a great deal of ground as game programming is a broad topic, but it fails to reach the depth at which the interesting problems begin to occur. The &#8220;techniques&#8221; described are all so basic as to be rediscoverable by any reasonably intelligent programmer on their first attempt at tackling similar problems. Perhaps a subject as broad as game development resists any useful survey, but I have a feeling that if someone of Knuth&#8217;s caliber took a crack at it, the interesting problems and solutions would make themselves known.</p>
