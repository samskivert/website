title: "Burning Man 2008"

<p>Through some combination of subconscious neglect and happy coincidence, I discovered that my camera battery was just about dead when I arrived at Burning Man. Thus I made a quick photo tour shortly after arrival and spent the rest of the event blissfully free of any feeling of responsibility to document my adventures.</p>
