  <p>Though Angela Gheorghiu has a stunning voice, and the orchestra was fantastic, the otherwise straightforward rendition of <cite>Tosca</cite> on film was less rather than more than the live performance I&#8217;d seen a year or so earlier. The lip syncing was tough not to notice and the simple sets left one feeling that the full power of a cinematic rendition was far from realized.</p>
