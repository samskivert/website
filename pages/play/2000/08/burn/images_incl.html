<div class="title">Preparing the machine</div>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/20/mvc00001.jpg" />
<div>a week before the event, we enlisted the help of our friend anita and went to work painting the base coat on the machine.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/20/mvc00004.jpg" />
<div>one by one the boards became colorful skin for the machine.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/20/mvc00006.jpg" />
<div>we worked late into the afternoon (me too i swear, i just happened to be the one taking the pictures).</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/20/mvc00011.jpg" />
<div>we were joined by a feline friend at some point during the painting. it was all we could do to keep him from pitter pattering all over our freshly painted boards.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/20/mvc00016.jpg" />
<div>at some point jesus showed up and was kind enough to give us his blessing.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/20/mvc00019.jpg" />
<div>he blessed our wood.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/20/mvc00022.jpg" />
<div>he blessed our paint.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/20/mvc00024.jpg" />
<div>and blessed, colorful paint it was.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/20/mvc00026.jpg" />
<div>when all was said and done, we hauled all the wood back into my garage and waited anxiously for our departure.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="title">Monday on the playa</div>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/28/mvc00036.jpg" />
<div>we arrived late sunday night and started work on the machine monday morning.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/28/mvc00038.jpg" />
<div>i did my best to paint the sneetches as accurately as possible given my complete lack of skill as a painter.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/28/mvc00039.jpg" />
<div>the star-bellied sneetch was clearly the happier of the two and we hoped that our subconcious ploy would augment peoples' natural desire for a star on their belly.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/28/mvc00041.jpg" />
<div>meanwhile, the pirates of <i>Camp Aaargh!</i> were busily setting up their pirate vessel.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/28/mvc00042.jpg" />
<div>ray had decorated his bike in a seussian style.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/28/mvc00043.jpg" />
<div>t-smooth (my tortoise) had come along to keep us company.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/28/mvc00044.jpg" />
<div>before long, the primary structure was erected.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/28/mvc00046.jpg" />
<div>then the entrance was added.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/28/mvc00048.jpg" />
<div>and the exit.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/28/mvc00050.jpg" />
<div>angela set to drawing the label on the machine while ray went to work painting a black outline along the edges.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/28/mvc00052.jpg" />
<div>meanwhile, vic, adam and peter, did a fine job of supervising.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/28/mvc00053.jpg" />
<div>once the structure was complete, we began to stock it with the star-onning supplies.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/28/mvc00054.jpg" />
<div>we had body paints, fabrics, glitter, fluffy things, beads, leis, wings, hats, thread, needles, a glue gun, velcro and of course, a rubber chicken.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/28/mvc00056.jpg" />
<div>the lamb-skins on which the star-onnees laid while they were being starred turned out to be a stroke of genius.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/28/mvc00062.jpg" />
<div>by late afternoon, the machine was stocked, the outline painted and angela was putting the final touches on the sign.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/28/mvc00064.jpg" />
<div>the finished product was a glorious realization of ray and my original vision. all that remained was to see how it was received by the general public. we retired for the evening and made plans for our grand unveiling the next day.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="title">Tuesday: our first day of operation</div>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00066.jpg" />
<div>the pirates were all moved into their piratey vessel by the next morning.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00068.jpg" />
<div>we opened the machine up for business and were quickly overwhelmed with customers. much like in the story, many sneetches wore only minimal clothing.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00070.jpg" />
<div>caught up in the excitement, even the pirates wanted stars (though not on their bellies because it wasn't <i>piratey</i> enough).</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00072.jpg" />
<div>more happy customers.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00073.jpg" />
<div>some sneetches got matching stars.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00074.jpg" />
<div>later that day, i took some star-onning materials on the road and did some remote starring in mauck and kitts's lawn camp.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00075.jpg" />
<div>lying on cool grass in the heat of the desert while someone paints a star on your belly is truly a divine experience (or so i was told).</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00076.jpg" />
<div>being a flexible star-onner, i never insisted that stars go on the belly and this helped to increase my star-throughput.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00077.jpg" />
<div>there's nothing better than the smile on a happy sneetch.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00078.jpg" />
<div>my friend steven, who i met last year at burning man, showed up and requested an eight pointed star.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00079.jpg" />
<div>while i was off field-starring, the machine was getting a real workout.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00080.jpg" />
<div>we were really starting to flex our technique at this point, doing 3D stars and some very interesting breast work.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00081.jpg" />
<div>the parade of sneetches wanting stars showed no signs of slowing.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00082.jpg" />
<div>we even did our best to star-on through some pretty thick layers of belly hair.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00083.jpg" />
<div>just look at these happy sneetches.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00085.jpg" />
<div>there were sneetches with beer.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00086.jpg" />
<div>and sneetches with cheer.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00087.jpg" />
<div>sneetches coming in packs of three.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00084.jpg" />
<div>some wanted stars on backs.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00088.jpg" />
<div>some stars that matched.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00089.jpg" />
<div>but all were filled with a sneetchly glee.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/29/mvc00092.jpg" />
<div>by sundown the first night, we knew that the star-onning machine was destined to bring smiles to the faces of sneetches all the playa 'round.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="title">Wednesday: haars and stars</div>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/30/mvc00093.jpg" />
<div>on wednesday, we sneetches went out for a tour of the playa and came back to find the pirates manning the machine. just as we suspected, they were really sneetchly pirates at heart. they did a smashing job of starring-on, though we didn't get many pictures that day.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/30/mvc00095.jpg" />
<div>daniel gives us a hearty haar as he puts the final touches on happy belly.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="title">Thursday: more stars upon thars</div>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/31/mvc00096.jpg" />
<div>we returned from our thursday morning adventures to find that the machine was in full operation by volunteer sneetches that had just happened along earlier that morning.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/31/mvc00098.jpg" />
<div>this whole star-onning business was turning out to be easier than we thought. if it wasn't so much fun painting stars on bellies, we could have let the machine just run itself.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/31/mvc00099.jpg" />
<div>later that afternoon we picked up our sneetch-u-mentary.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/31/mvc00100.jpg" />
<div>though the weather was getting a bit chilly, the sneetches continued to make their way to the machine.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/31/mvc00101.jpg" />
<div>some were more brightly colored than others.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/08/31/mvc00102.jpg" />
<div>but all displayed that incomparable sneetchly spirit.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="title">Friday stars</div>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/09/01/mvc00103.jpg" />
<div>friday was even more chilly and we sneetches were a bit under the weather having not slept on thursday night. we took that as further challenge and did some of our best work.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/09/01/mvc00104.jpg" />
<div>there was a <i>critical tits</i> bike ride later that day and we did our part to decorate the riders. </div>
</div><br/>
<div class="title">Saturday: the day of the burn</div>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/09/02/mvc00105.jpg" />
<div>despite further inclement weather, we did our best to get all willing sneetches into top form for the burn on saturday night. we didn't do much documenting, but many glorious stars were painted and many happy sneetches were sent off with stars upon thars.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="title">Sunday: burn baby, burn</div>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/09/03/mvc00108.jpg" />
<div>on sunday, it was time to dismantle the machine and, in the true spirit of the event, burn it in the name of all things sneetchly.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/09/03/mvc00109.jpg" />
<div>a week's worth of starring had left it a bit disheveled, but well decorated and very <i>lived in</i>.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/09/03/mvc00112.jpg" />
<div>we had received many lovely gifts in exchange for the stars, some of which adorned the walls.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/09/03/mvc00115.jpg" />
<div>in the end, the machine burned just as nicely as it operated in the days before.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="/media/photography/2000/09/03/mvc00118.jpg" />
<div>we bid the machine and our fellow sneetches goodbye and look forward to more fun next year. viva la sneetch!</div>
</div><br/>
