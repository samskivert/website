  <p>I now realize why this film took so long to be released in the States. The whole business of veering incongruously into future land wouldn&#8217;t go over well with American audiences. The rest of the film, however, just didn&#8217;t hang together. It&#8217;s possible that Wong Kar Wai was going for sort of a collection of vignettes, something like he did in Chungking Express, but it just didn&#8217;t work.</p>
