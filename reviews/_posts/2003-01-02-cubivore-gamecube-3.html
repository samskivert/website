  <p>Ranks up with <cite>Space Station Silicon Valley</cite> as one of the most peculiar game concepts I&#8217;ve ever come across. Sets the bar for best translation of a Japanese game into English with the seemingly unenedless supply of expertly translated poetry that is recited to you by your Cubivore alter-ego throughout the game. The gameplay is reasonably fun and though I wasn&#8217;t motivated to play through a second time and achieve the status of King Cubivore, I certainly enjoyed the first go &#8217;round.</p>
