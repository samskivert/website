Here is an LED clock, much like the one on your VCR that tells you
when the power has been out. It will continue to flash until you click on
the numbers and set the time. Go ahead, we'll wait.

<br clear=all><p><center><applet code="SettableClock" width=85 height=28></applet></center>

<p> If you've just set the clock to the correct time, then you are a geek.
Face it.  You're watching it right now to see if it's correctly keeping
time.  Ha! Now you've been sucked in.  You've played with the applet, and
you're going to read the rest of this.  Our ploy has been successful.  You
see, we have interrupted the regularly scheduled Deep Magic to bring you
an important message: We need help!

align=left> Deep Magic is normally written by the magic-makers here at
go2net; and don't get us wrong, we love doing it. We also have a busy
schedule of making magic for the company, and writing Deep Magic can
really put bags under our eyes.  We need more writers, and are hoping
maybe you, oh humble reader, could write for Deep Magic.

<p> Earn the fame you deserve! See your name on our pages! Amaze your
friends with illegibly commented Java code written at three in the
morning! Confuse your enemies with same! And get started saving enough
money for a computer with the Amazing MegaHertz Nine Billion!!

<p> Really -- if you are the type of person who enjoys each weekly
installment of Deep Magic (and especially if you set the clock), then you
may be qualified to write for it! Think of your mother, won't it make her
proud?  Think of us, the programmers of go2net, busy with various secret
Alpaca rocketry projects.

<p> If you are interested in finding out more, please contact <a
href="mailto:paulp@go2net.com">&lt;paulp@go2net.com&gt;</a>, and tell him
confidently, "I have the magic." <a href="/internet/deep/"
