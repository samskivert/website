  <p>A meandering, style-heavy, idea-light attempt to communicate the magic of a far future world where humanity spans the galaxy and has made contact with myriad alien species and the artifacts of millions of years old civilizations. It misses the mark on the exciting science as well as on the human drama and chugs along thanks only to a few tormented characters and periodic attempts to wow us with things that are very old or very large.</p>
