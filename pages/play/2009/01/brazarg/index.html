My friend <a href="http://dahstudio.com/">Anita</a> holds a fabulous yoga
retreat every year and invited me to go scouting the location for 2009.
Originally we were headed to Thailand and India, but after our
reservations at the Taj were canceled due to bombings and the Bangkok airport
was shut down in a sit-in protest, we decided to reroute to less newsworthy
locales. Brazil and Argentina seemed nice, so we got tickets and and hopped on
a plane.
