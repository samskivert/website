<p>I didn’t actually finish FF12, but given that I played like 60 or 70 hours, I figured I might as well mention it. It’s been a long time since I’ve played a proper RPG and I think the only thing that got me as far as I did in FF12 was the excellent gambit system. Such a stroke of genius to take the tedious and automatable process of random encounter battles and automate with a programming-like metagame wherein one has fun programming and has fun watching their programs deal deftly with their foes. The stellar production values and decent writing no doubt helped as well.
