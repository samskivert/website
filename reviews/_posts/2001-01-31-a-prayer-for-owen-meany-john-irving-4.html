category: books

  <p>To use terminology of the period, this book blew my mind. Irving told a compelling tale that came together with an impact that nearly knocked me out of my chair. Owen Meany was an unending delight and I wept for him at his funeral as if he were a dear friend. It is a testament to Irving&#8217;s skill that this book moved me so much more than the myriad excellent works I&#8217;ve recently read that cover themes substantially closer to those I&#8217;m struggling with in my own life.</p>
