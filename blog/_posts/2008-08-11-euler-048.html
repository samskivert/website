title: "Euler 048"

<p><a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=48">Problem 048</a>:</p>
<pre>
object Euler48 extends Application {
  println(1.to(1000).map(a =&gt; BigInt(a).pow(a)).reduceRight(_+_) % BigInt(10).pow(10))
}
</pre>
<p>The Right Thing â„¢ here was to not rely on the magic of BigInt, but to do the addition modulo 10^10 as well as to compute the powers modulo 10^10, but laziness and the allure of a one line solution won out in the end.
