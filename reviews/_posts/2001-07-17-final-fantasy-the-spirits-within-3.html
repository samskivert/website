  <p>Another fine IMAX viewing. I went to see this film to experience the state of the art in CGI (computer generated imaging) and was pleasantly surprised by a decent plot, creative cinematography and a reasonable rendition of the standard mythology. The animation was incredible and foreshadows the potential for fully computer generated films. It&#8217;s definitely worth seeing if you appreciate the technical achievement, and almost worth seeing even if you don&#8217;t.</p>
