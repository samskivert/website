<p> Video games have long captured the imaginations of computer users both
young and old.  Let us now hearken back to the early days of computer gaming,
when the TV was the monitor, the "game paddle" was the latest input device,
and pixels were the size of <a
href="http://www.quakeroatmeal.com/QuakerOats/CAPN.HTM" target="_blank">Cap'n
Crunch</a> cereal.  Nowadays, the marketing gurus of the computer companies
worldwide have decreed that if a game isn't <a href="01.html"
target="define"><b>3-D and first-person</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">1</font></sup>, it just won't sell.  True gaming aficionados,
however, know that video games originated from much <a href="02.html"
target="define"><b>humbler</b></a><sup><font size="-1">2</font></sup>
beginnings.  Enter <a href="http://www.sponsor.net/~gchance/PongStuff/PongFAQ"
target="_blank">Pong</a>, a simple 2-D black-and-white affair in which two
paddles knock a ball about until it flies off the edge of the screen.

<p> Although the <a
href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/games/video-games/faq/part1/faq.html"
target="_blank">rec.games.video FAQ</a> is quick to point out that Pong was
not truly the first arcade game, this pointed clarification is a clue to the
historical importance of the game.  'Tis odd indeed to imagine a white square
as a ball, a white line as a paddle, and hordes of people clustered around
their home televisions staring at said graphics in amazement.  Yet stare they did, and as
the money flowed, so too did the ball continue to bounce endlessly <a
href="03.html" target="define"><b>to and fro</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">3</font></sup>.

<p> As <a
href="http://www.denken.or.jp/local/misc/JARGON/body-m/Moore.s@Law.html"
target="_blank">Moore's Law</a> dictates, technology progressed and computer
games grew in complexity as well.  Yet the time-honored tradition of
ball-bouncing and paddle-sliding never dissipated completely, for nearly every
computing platform since the early days has had its own implementations of
Pong available.  As one might expect, the recent influx of Java in the
computer industry has spawned a multitude of Pong imitations, clones and
lookalikes.  Amazingly, none of these <a
href="http://www.gamelan.com/find.cgi?and=pong&howmany=all"
target="_blank">imitations</a> have yet begun to approach the true <a
href="04.html" target="define"><b>look and feel</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">4</font></sup> of the <a
href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~brownde/museum/history/gen1/pong/pong.html"
target="_blank">classic arcade game</a>.
 
<p> The lack of a quality Java Pong implementation is particularly
disheartening considering that "those who do not learn from history are doomed
to repeat it."  Interpreted <a href="05.html"
target="define"><b>literally</b></a><sup><font size="-1">5</font></sup>, this
could be taken to mean that Java programmers are fated to produce one inferior
Pong clone after another, never quite attaining the pinnacle of success
celebrated by Pong itself in the late 1970s.  This vicious cycle will
undoubtedly continue until such time as an implementation sufficiently
reminiscent of the original classic appears.  In the interest of furthering
the viability of the Java computing platform, I have taken it upon myself to
rectify the situation.  I present to you
<a href="pang.html" target="pang" onClick="return open_pang('pang');"><b>"Pang,"</b></a> in full glowing
monochromatic color.

<p><b>No Pang, No Gain</b>

<br>My version of Pong is christened Pang for two simple <a href="06.html"
target="define"><b>reasons</b></a><sup><font size="-1">6</font></sup>. First,
I would like to believe that the past tense of Pong is Pang, rather than
"Ponged." Second, experienced Pong players will undoubtedly
experience a <i>pang</i> of remorse for the golden age of computers while
playing.  Insofar as possible, Pang is replete with the original
idiosyncracies we all grew to know and love.  Born before the days of color,
Pong grew, lived and died in an era which forced early adopters to fiddle
endlessly with their RF adapters in a vain attempt to clarify the television
picture.  Best of all, use of the <a
href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~brownde/museum/history/gen1/pong/atpong.gif"
target="_blank">Pong unit</a> always seemed to result in the appearance of
lingering <a href="07.html" target="define"><b>vertical hold</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">7</font></sup> lines in the midst of the display.  Such drama!

<p> The mouse is used to control the left paddle during game play, as true
game paddles have fallen into disfavor of late.  A simple mouse click toggles
between demo mode and game play.  As in the original, the player embodies the
heart, mind and soul of a simple paddle.  Scheming and conniving is fruitless
when confronted with such simple complexity, as the astute reader will quickly
observe.  To succeed, the player must transcend the paddle and become one with
the ball itself.  Players would be wise to recall <a
href="http://www.duke.edu/~apg/caddy/snds/tywebb/force.au">the
words of Chevy Chase</a> in the movie <a
href="http://www.duke.edu/~apg/caddy/shack.html" target="_blank">Caddy
Shack</a>: "Be the ball, Billy.  Be the ball."

<p> I have simulated in the game above the mind-cleansing "full vertical roll"
those lucky few with older televisions experienced.  Note also the "5 A.M.
undead pixels dancing before your eyes," seen here in the background twitching
perpetually back and forth .  The V-Hold line mentioned previously appears now
and again, and the wonderfully archaic computerized sound effects are sure to
bring smiles to the faces of all true Pangers. As parents are wont to say 
on their child's 18th birthday, "Go nuts."

<p>For those idealists in the audience, I also offer a look at
<a href="pang_lite.html" target="pang" onClick="return open_pang('pang_lite');"><b>Pang in Utopia</b></a>, free of the pleasantries
described above.

<p><b>Pangs a Lot</b>

<br> Presented with Pang in all its glory, nervous game historians, venture
capitalists, and Java commentators the world over can now rest peacefully on
their haunches, aglow with satisfaction at this ultimate demonstration of
Java's maturity.  Hedonistic game players are invited to while away the wee
hours of the night in mortal combat with their screen's pixels.  Programmers
are welcome to peruse the complete <i>100% Pure</i> Java source code to Pang,
available below.  For those seeking Java projects, Pang yearns for a myriad of
additions and modifications, such as background music, a score-keeper, and
playing-field obstacles.
 
<p> At some point in history, Pong was nothing but a gleam in a programmer's
eye, much as Pang was in mine mere days ago.  As Pong was carried forward
through the ages, other classics such as <a
href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/eos/users/m/msstowe/WWW/Pac-Man/pac-man.html"
target="_blank">Pac-Man</a> and <a
href="http://cisr.anu.edu.au/~sam/java/my_code/frogger.html"
target="_blank">Frogger</a> followed in its footsteps.  Similarly, my hope is
that Pang will set the stage for a multitude of more advanced, equally
respectable and wholly entertaining Java game creations.  The burgeoning
crowds of Java programmers must rush to fill the void of quality
cross-platform computer gaming, else they be doomed to repeat past failures
until they learn from their mistakes.  It is paradoxes such as these which
prompted me to create Pang in the first place, and which leave me wondering
whether I have in fact created a worthy successor.  Perhaps I have simply
repeated the mistakes made by the original programmer of Pong?

<p>Enjoying oneself can be such a shameful thing, after all.
