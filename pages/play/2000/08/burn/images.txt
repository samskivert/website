title Preparing the machine
image 2000/08/20/mvc00001.jpg a week before the event, we enlisted the help of our friend anita and went to work painting the base coat on the machine.
image 2000/08/20/mvc00004.jpg one by one the boards became colorful skin for the machine.
image 2000/08/20/mvc00006.jpg we worked late into the afternoon (me too i swear, i just happened to be the one taking the pictures).
image 2000/08/20/mvc00011.jpg we were joined by a feline friend at some point during the painting. it was all we could do to keep him from pitter pattering all over our freshly painted boards.
image 2000/08/20/mvc00016.jpg at some point jesus showed up and was kind enough to give us his blessing.
image 2000/08/20/mvc00019.jpg he blessed our wood.
image 2000/08/20/mvc00022.jpg he blessed our paint.
image 2000/08/20/mvc00024.jpg and blessed, colorful paint it was.
image 2000/08/20/mvc00026.jpg when all was said and done, we hauled all the wood back into my garage and waited anxiously for our departure.
title Monday on the playa
image 2000/08/28/mvc00036.jpg we arrived late sunday night and started work on the machine monday morning.
image 2000/08/28/mvc00038.jpg i did my best to paint the sneetches as accurately as possible given my complete lack of skill as a painter.
image 2000/08/28/mvc00039.jpg the star-bellied sneetch was clearly the happier of the two and we hoped that our subconcious ploy would augment peoples' natural desire for a star on their belly.
image 2000/08/28/mvc00041.jpg meanwhile, the pirates of <i>Camp Aaargh!</i> were busily setting up their pirate vessel.
image 2000/08/28/mvc00042.jpg ray had decorated his bike in a seussian style.
image 2000/08/28/mvc00043.jpg t-smooth (my tortoise) had come along to keep us company.
image 2000/08/28/mvc00044.jpg before long, the primary structure was erected.
image 2000/08/28/mvc00046.jpg then the entrance was added.
image 2000/08/28/mvc00048.jpg and the exit.
image 2000/08/28/mvc00050.jpg angela set to drawing the label on the machine while ray went to work painting a black outline along the edges.
image 2000/08/28/mvc00052.jpg meanwhile, vic, adam and peter, did a fine job of supervising.
image 2000/08/28/mvc00053.jpg once the structure was complete, we began to stock it with the star-onning supplies.
image 2000/08/28/mvc00054.jpg we had body paints, fabrics, glitter, fluffy things, beads, leis, wings, hats, thread, needles, a glue gun, velcro and of course, a rubber chicken.
image 2000/08/28/mvc00056.jpg the lamb-skins on which the star-onnees laid while they were being starred turned out to be a stroke of genius.
image 2000/08/28/mvc00062.jpg by late afternoon, the machine was stocked, the outline painted and angela was putting the final touches on the sign.
image 2000/08/28/mvc00064.jpg the finished product was a glorious realization of ray and my original vision. all that remained was to see how it was received by the general public. we retired for the evening and made plans for our grand unveiling the next day.
title Tuesday: our first day of operation
image 2000/08/29/mvc00066.jpg the pirates were all moved into their piratey vessel by the next morning.
image 2000/08/29/mvc00068.jpg we opened the machine up for business and were quickly overwhelmed with customers. much like in the story, many sneetches wore only minimal clothing.
image 2000/08/29/mvc00070.jpg caught up in the excitement, even the pirates wanted stars (though not on their bellies because it wasn't <i>piratey</i> enough).
image 2000/08/29/mvc00072.jpg more happy customers.
image 2000/08/29/mvc00073.jpg some sneetches got matching stars.
image 2000/08/29/mvc00074.jpg later that day, i took some star-onning materials on the road and did some remote starring in mauck and kitts's lawn camp.
image 2000/08/29/mvc00075.jpg lying on cool grass in the heat of the desert while someone paints a star on your belly is truly a divine experience (or so i was told).
image 2000/08/29/mvc00076.jpg being a flexible star-onner, i never insisted that stars go on the belly and this helped to increase my star-throughput.
image 2000/08/29/mvc00077.jpg there's nothing better than the smile on a happy sneetch.
image 2000/08/29/mvc00078.jpg my friend steven, who i met last year at burning man, showed up and requested an eight pointed star.
image 2000/08/29/mvc00079.jpg while i was off field-starring, the machine was getting a real workout.
image 2000/08/29/mvc00080.jpg we were really starting to flex our technique at this point, doing 3D stars and some very interesting breast work.
image 2000/08/29/mvc00081.jpg the parade of sneetches wanting stars showed no signs of slowing.
image 2000/08/29/mvc00082.jpg we even did our best to star-on through some pretty thick layers of belly hair.
image 2000/08/29/mvc00083.jpg just look at these happy sneetches.
image 2000/08/29/mvc00085.jpg there were sneetches with beer.
image 2000/08/29/mvc00086.jpg and sneetches with cheer.
image 2000/08/29/mvc00087.jpg sneetches coming in packs of three.
image 2000/08/29/mvc00084.jpg some wanted stars on backs.
image 2000/08/29/mvc00088.jpg some stars that matched.
image 2000/08/29/mvc00089.jpg but all were filled with a sneetchly glee.
image 2000/08/29/mvc00092.jpg by sundown the first night, we knew that the star-onning machine was destined to bring smiles to the faces of sneetches all the playa 'round.
title Wednesday: haars and stars
image 2000/08/30/mvc00093.jpg on wednesday, we sneetches went out for a tour of the playa and came back to find the pirates manning the machine. just as we suspected, they were really sneetchly pirates at heart. they did a smashing job of starring-on, though we didn't get many pictures that day.
image 2000/08/30/mvc00095.jpg daniel gives us a hearty haar as he puts the final touches on happy belly.
title Thursday: more stars upon thars
image 2000/08/31/mvc00096.jpg we returned from our thursday morning adventures to find that the machine was in full operation by volunteer sneetches that had just happened along earlier that morning.
image 2000/08/31/mvc00098.jpg this whole star-onning business was turning out to be easier than we thought. if it wasn't so much fun painting stars on bellies, we could have let the machine just run itself.
image 2000/08/31/mvc00099.jpg later that afternoon we picked up our sneetch-u-mentary.
image 2000/08/31/mvc00100.jpg though the weather was getting a bit chilly, the sneetches continued to make their way to the machine.
image 2000/08/31/mvc00101.jpg some were more brightly colored than others.
image 2000/08/31/mvc00102.jpg but all displayed that incomparable sneetchly spirit.
title Friday stars
image 2000/09/01/mvc00103.jpg friday was even more chilly and we sneetches were a bit under the weather having not slept on thursday night. we took that as further challenge and did some of our best work.
image 2000/09/01/mvc00104.jpg there was a <i>critical tits</i> bike ride later that day and we did our part to decorate the riders. 
title Saturday: the day of the burn
image 2000/09/02/mvc00105.jpg despite further inclement weather, we did our best to get all willing sneetches into top form for the burn on saturday night. we didn't do much documenting, but many glorious stars were painted and many happy sneetches were sent off with stars upon thars.
title Sunday: burn baby, burn
image 2000/09/03/mvc00106.jpg
image 2000/09/03/mvc00108.jpg on sunday, it was time to dismantle the machine and, in the true spirit of the event, burn it in the name of all things sneetchly.
image 2000/09/03/mvc00109.jpg a week's worth of starring had left it a bit disheveled, but well decorated and very <i>lived in</i>.
image 2000/09/03/mvc00112.jpg we had received many lovely gifts in exchange for the stars, some of which adorned the walls.
image 2000/09/03/mvc00115.jpg in the end, the machine burned just as nicely as it operated in the days before.
image 2000/09/03/mvc00118.jpg we bid the machine and our fellow sneetches goodbye and look forward to more fun next year. viva la sneetch!
