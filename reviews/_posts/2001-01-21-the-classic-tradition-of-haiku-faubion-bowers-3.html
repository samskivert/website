  <p>The haiku in the book are written by people widely considered to be masters of haiku. In reading the poems, I discovered that, unlike almost all other poetry that I&#8217;ve read, I actually find haiku appealing. I can understand the structure of it, and it&#8217;s sufficiently simple that the poems are meaningful to me. They evoke imagery in my mind and communicate, however simply. Being able to appreciate haiku in native Japanese is now yet another motivator to learn the language.</p>
