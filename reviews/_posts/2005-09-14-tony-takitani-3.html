  <p>Being a giant fan of Murakami&#8217;s novels, I am relieved to report that <cite>Tony Takitani</cite> is pretty good. I hadn&#8217;t read the short story on which the film is based (I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s been translated) but the film did a great job of capturing that Murakami esssence. The pace is erratic and though one gets the strong feeling that this is a social commentary, it&#8217;s not obvious what in the hell the comment is, which is also very Murakami. I dug it the most.</p>
