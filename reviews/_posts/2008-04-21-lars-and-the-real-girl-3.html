<p>Charmingly bizarre. Likable but dysfunctional man mail orders a sex doll and earnestly tries to pass her off as his new girlfriend. Having the whole town attempt to just play along is a recipe for comedy. If your friends can’t put up with your aluminum and silicon imaginary girlfriend, then what kind of friends are they? The writer apparently saw an ad for the Real Doll and came up with this crazy premise. I have to admit that’s not what popped into my mind when I first saw the Real Doll, but perhaps I am at a gender disadvantage.
