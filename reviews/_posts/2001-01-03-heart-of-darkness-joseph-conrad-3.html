  <p>I&#8217;m always surprised by the lucidity of writing in the classics and Heart of Darkness is no exception. I want to say that Conrad hits on some universal truths and captures the human condition without sounding trite and repeating phrases that were utterly meaningless to me when I heard them used to describe the sorts of books I was reading in junior high. I suppose that if I could do that, I&#8217;d be writing classics of my own. You&#8217;ll just have to read it for yourself. At a little over 100 pages, it&#8217;s not even a risky investment. Having been unable to finish my previous two endeavors, Heart of Darkness was a breath of fresh air both in readability and in compactness.</p>
