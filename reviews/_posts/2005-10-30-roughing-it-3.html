  <p>A wide ranging autobiographical tale of Mark Twain&#8217;s young adulthood in Nevada during the silver mining heyday, around Tahoe for a bit, in San Francisco during the gold rush, and even spending a bit of time on the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii). Fascinating for the depiction of the times (late 1800s) and brimming with hilarious spit and vinegar as one would expect from the author.</p>
