<p>A mostly readable investigation into the nature of time. When the author is talking physics, it’s good going, when he veers into philosophy or neuroscience, not so much. That doesn’t come as a big surprise given that he’s a physicist, but it causes the book to drag on a bit, providing an object lesson in our subjective perception of time.</p>
