  <p>This film felt like a mild roller coaster ride with a guy standing at the end to punch you in the gut before you leave. While it wasn&#8217;t as well executed as something like <cite>Requiem for a Dream</cite>, I enjoyed Depp&#8217;s performance and found the times and trials of the life of George Jung to be interesting.</p>
