<tt>For the real rock-dwellers among us, Alan Turing invented (in 1936,
slightly before von Neumann developed CAs) a machine that he proved to be
powerful enough to compute anything that was computable. The downside to his
machine (aside from its enormous storage requirements) was that its programs
tended to be extremely lengthy strings of ones, zeros and spaces.</tt>
