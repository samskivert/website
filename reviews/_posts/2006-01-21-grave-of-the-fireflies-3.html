	<p>I oscillated between sympathy and disgust for the protagonist, who struggled to keep his and his sister’s lives from falling apart after their home was destroyed and mother killed in a WWII bombing run. I suppose I’m just supposed to sit back and absorb the tragedy of it all, but I wouldn’t have done the things he did.
