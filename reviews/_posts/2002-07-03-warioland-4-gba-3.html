  <p>A worthy addition to the Warioland series and one of my favorite GBA games thus far. It has all the great platformer elements of the GBC Warioland games and more. The domino level, the pinball level and the toy factory level were inspired. To top it off, the music is fantastic as well. Pure jumping goodness.</p>
