<p>I will admit to enjoying yet another reimagining of an old series, but I wonâ€™t admit to enjoying the half-baked time travel plot. I appreciate that it was most likely cooked up to give carte blanche to future writers who wish to be free from the shackles of Star Trek canon. I even appreciate that future films will probably be better for it. I just wish they could have accomplished their goal in a manner less lame.</p>
