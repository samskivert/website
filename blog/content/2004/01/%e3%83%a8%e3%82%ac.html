  <p>I went to my first yoga class today. How fascinating it was to reverse engineer the instructor&#8217;s running commentary from only a knowledge of the grammatical structure and the things we were supposed to be doing with our bodies. I learned so many new nouns and verbs! I did get a little lost when he started talking about India and energy flow but at least I now know how tell people to bring their gaze to their nose in Japanese.</p>
