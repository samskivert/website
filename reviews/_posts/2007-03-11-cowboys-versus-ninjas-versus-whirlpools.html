<p>Daniel and I gave <a href="https://www.cmpevents.com/GD07/a.asp?option=C&amp;V=11&amp;SessID=3717">a talk</a> at the GDC again this year (well, Daniel gave about half a dozen of them, but I don’t share his enthusiasm for public speaking). We divulged the juicy details on OOO’s financial performance, <a href="http://www.banghowdy.com">Bang!’s</a> early metrics and gave a demo of our new project <a href="http://www.whirled.com/">Whirled</a>. Have a look at <a href="http://samskivert.com/work/2007/gdc/ooo_gdc_2007.pdf">the slides</a> if you go for that sort of thing.
