title: "Joining the club"
---

  <p>I can&#8217;t say that I have a strong feeling about blogs one way or the other. I had a short lived fling with <a href="http://www.livejournal.com">LiveJournal</a>, but we parted ways amicably many months back as I was feeling guilty for being so neglectful.</p>
<p>Given the arrival of the New Year and my own arrival in Tokyo just two days past, I figured it was time to rekindle the flame with self-indulgence, lacking style and banal commentary. Thus, I&#8217;ve joined the club of geeks abroad taking advantage of the miracle of the Internet to bore unsuspecting readers with their experiences and reflections.</p>
<p>Really I&#8217;m doing this so that I won&#8217;t feel so guilty about shirking the responsibility of keeping in touch with my friends back home. Plus, I&#8217;m sure all this English writing will do wonders for my Japanese.</p>
