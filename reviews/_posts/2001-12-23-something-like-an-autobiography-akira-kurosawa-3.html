  <p>Interesting not only for the view into the mind of one of my favorite directors, but also for the perspective of someone growing up in barely post-feudal Japan and living through WWII. The tale ends with the production and release of <cite>Rashoman</cite>, which leaves out a lot of interesting films and events from Kurosawa&#8217;s life, leaving me hoping that he produces a second volume covering the remainder of his life before it comes to an end.</p>
