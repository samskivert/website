<p>There are few topics in computer science that are as diversely
applicable and as actively explored as cellular automata. Much of the
research going on in computer science today finds some basis in cellular
automata or utilizes cellular automata in some fashion. It has turned up
in artificial life, image processing, distributed computing, and
encryption, to name a few. In fact, it doesn't stop at computer science;
cellular automata have been used to model population growth, urban
development, energy diffusion in a gas, decentralized goal-oriented
behavior, and an enormous list of other things that I don't care to
enumerate.

<p>Now that you're sufficiently intrigued by the topic, I'll proceed to give
you just enough background on cellular automata to get yourself in trouble at
<a href="01.html" target="define"><b>parties</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">1</font></sup>. First, a <a href="02.html"
target="define"><b>definition</b></a><sup><font size="-1">2</font></sup>
suitably detailed to allow the article to make sense and suitably vague so as
to annoy the mathematicians:

<p><blockquote>
<tt>A <a href="03.html" target="define"><b>CA </b></a><sup><font
size="-1">3</font></sup>is characterized by a set of cells and a set of
rules. The cells are commonly, but not necessarily (as we'll see later)
organized into a two-dimensional grid extending infinitely in both
directions. The cells have characteristics or <i>states</i>, generally
something along the lines of on/off or a numerical value.

<br><br>A generation is one particular set of cell states. The rules describe how
to generate the next generation given the current generation. They are usually
something along the lines of "if a cell has exactly three neighbors in state 1
and it is in state 0, it's new state is 1." The rules are applied to each cell
in the <a href="05.html" target="define"><b>grid</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">5</font></sup> and the result is the next generation.
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>As has probably already occurred to you, this is a very open ended
description. The cell states can be extremely complex, as can the rule
sets. What will become <a href="06.html" target="define"><b>increasingly
apparent</b></a><sup><font size="-1">6</font></sup> by the end of the article
is that CAs are a different approach to computing, one that lends itself very
well to some problems that are difficult to solve with conventional computing
techniques.

<p><b>Machine copy machine</b><br>

In the late 1940's a mathematician by the name of <a href="07.html"
target="define"><b>John von Neumann</b></a><sup><font size="-1">7</font></sup>
began to develop the ideas that would eventually <a href="08.html"
target="define"><b>flourish</b></a><sup><font size="-1">8</font></sup> into
the theory of cellular automata. His interests varied from <a href="09.html"
target="define"><b>game theory</b></a><sup><font size="-1">9</font></sup> to
self-reproducing machines. The latter is what led him to develop cellular
automata.

<p> Building an actual machine that, in turn, built a copy of itself is no
small task even today. It comes as no surprise that fifty years ago, von
Neumann opted to <a href="10.html"
target="define"><b>develop</b></a><sup><font size="-1">10</font></sup> a
mathematical world in which machine copying machines could operate.

<p> He devised a cellular automaton that consisted of an infinite
two-dimensional grid of cells that could take on any of 29 states and a large
number of transition rules. His reproducing <i>machine</i> consisted of a
rectangular organization of cells followed by an extremely long tail. Within
the rectangular part of the machine, there existed a number of
suborganisms. The factory suborganism arranged <i>materials</i> from the
environment, the duplicator suborganism read a series of instructions and
copied them and a <i>computer</i> orchestrated the whole process. All in all,
it is very <a href="11.html"
target="define"><b>Turing-machine-esque</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">11</font></sup>.

<p> It is interesting to reflect on the concepts of modularity and reusability
in light of the fact that von Neumann's self-reproducing <i>program</i>
consisted of over two hundred thousand cells arranged on a grid, each
containing one of 29 values. Perhaps the concept of code readability had yet
to be invented. Another interesting side note is that von Neumann's
self-reproducing machine has many parallels to the little self-reproducing
machines in each and every cell of your body. Many of the cellular organelles
are represented in von Neumann's machine, and 150,000 of those 200,000 cells
are his equivalent of DNA.

<p><b>Who says life isn't a game?</b><br>

Our next stop on the historical tour of CAs leads us to the realm of one <a
href="12.html" target="define"><b>John Conway</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">12</font></sup> and a little closer to the world of computing as it
is today. Conway posited that a rule set substantially smaller than the one
von Neumann developed could satisfy Turing's requirements for computational
capability and hence support a self-replicating <a href="13.html"
target="define"><b>machine</b></a><sup><font size="-1">13</font></sup>.

<p> To that end, in 1970 Conway <a href="14.html"
target="define"><b>developed</b></a><sup><font size="-1">14</font></sup> the
game of life. Life is a cellular automaton operating on a two-dimensional grid
of cells each of which can have only two states: dead or alive. The rules for
Life are also very simple:

<ol>
<li>If a cell has exactly two living neighbors, it stays as it is. Live cells
stay live and dead cells stay dead.

<li>If a cell has exactly three living neighbors a dead cell becomes alive and
a live cells stays alive.

<li>If a cell has any other number of living neighbors a dead cell stays dead
and a live cell becomes a dead cell.
</ol>

<p> These very simple rules can lead to extremely complex behavior given the
right arrangement of live cells. Conway experimented with this game a great
deal himself and following the publication of an article by Martin Gardner in
<a href="15.html" target="define"><b>Scientific American</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">15</font></sup> the rest of the world got in on the fun.

<p> Soon, a whole host of interesting <i>creatures</i> was discovered and
investigated. A very important one, known as the glider, is a configuration of
cells that manages

</table>

to <a href="16.html" target="define"><b>move itself</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">16</font></sup> diagonally across the cell grid by a convenient
series of cell deaths and births. It forms the basis for many complicated
organisms.

<p> Various organisms in life exhibit interesting properties, and while I can
only scratch the surface of what is possible, other people have put together
<a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~callahan/patterns/contents.html"
target="_blank">voluminous archives</a> of patterns. To get a feel for how the
game operates, take a look at some <a href="17.html" target="define"><b>still
life</b></a><sup><font size="-1">17</font></sup> patterns as well as some of
the more common <a href="18.html"
target="define"><b>blinkers</b></a><sup><font size="-1">18</font></sup>.

<p> Subsequent discoveries include logical AND and OR gates and even an <a
href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~callahan/patterns/adder.html"
target="_blank">entire adder</a> that adds values represented by streams of
gliders the sum being represented by another stream of gliders. These
discoveries certainly confirm Conway's idea that the Life CA was a Turing
computer. Little did he know that he was creating something that was just
plain <a href="19.html" target="define"><b>fun to watch</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">19</font></sup>.

<p><b>Controlled anarchy</b><br>

Thanks to technological progression in the past 25 years, we don't have to
move stones around on a Go board or conspire to develop nuclear weapons in
order to explore CAs. This increase in computer availability has been mirrored
by an explosive growth in research of cellular automata. Research in the field
of artificial life has developed as rapidly, and in the same time frame as the
thorough investigation of CAs. Like chocolate and peanut butter, these two
fields have come together with some very exciting results.

<p> A common characteristic of many biological systems is that of
decentralized control. There are no ring masters in nature, no command
central. The complex behavior that is observed must be explainable by some
other mechanism.. CAs give us the perfect environment for exploring systems
with no central control. Given that the rules are executed in parallel on
every cell, we can easily explore systems where simple <a href="20.html"
target="define"><b>local interaction</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">20</font></sup> takes place for a large population of cells over
some period of time.

<p> A compelling example of this is a <a target="_blank"
href="http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/Projects/starlogo/projects/termite.html">model
of termite behavior</a>.  Termites organize little chips of wood into large
piles, but being very small they can't see the big picture of where the piles
of chips are, and there are no helicopters above radioing instructions down to
the busily working termites. How can they achieve their goal?

<p> It turns out that a simple set of rules allows just such a goal to be
achieved. Suppose an initially random distribution of chips on a
two-dimensional grid. Along with the chips are some number of termites. These
termites wander around randomly until they encounter a chip, when they
encounter the chip, they pick it up and continue to wander randomly around
until they encounter another chip. They drop the first chip down next to the
second chip and wander off looking for another chip.

<p> This can be modeled as a cellular automaton with some simple rules. A cell
can contain a wood chip, a termite, neither, or both (we assume two termites
won't wander into the same cell). Each iteration, the termite wanders from its
current cell to a neighboring cell. If the cell contains a woodchip, it picks
it up. If it is carrying a woodchip and it wanders into a woodchip carrying
cell, it instead sets the woodchip down in an empty space next to the first
woodchip and then exits in some random direction from that cell.

<p> Take a look at <a href="21.html" target="define"><b>this
automaton</b></a><sup><font size="-1">21</font></sup> in action. The yellow
squares are wood chips and the red squares are termites. When the termites
pick up a wood chip, they turn blue. When they encounter a second wood chip,
they turn green which indicates that they'll set the first chip down in the
next empty space that they encounter. After many generations, the wood chips
begin to collect into piles, eventually into one large pile. Unfortunately,
Java doesn't quite boast the computing power to perform this simulation on a
large enough set of termites and chips to truly impress, but the beginnings of
the emergent behavior are definitely visible in the applet.
