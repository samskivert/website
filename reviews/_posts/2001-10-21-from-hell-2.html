  <p>Though I appreciated Depp&#8217;s performance as the dragon chasing, precognizant detective, the rest of the film failed to come together into any sort of compelling whole. All style and no substance. It&#8217;s a shame to see all of the talent that came together for this film short changed by a marginal script and less than inspired direction.</p>
