  <p>It starts out as a standard &#8220;Hollywood lifestyle&#8221; film and then veers sharply when everyone takes some ecstasy and the conflicts that were subtly building earlier in the film get dragged, kicking and screaming, into the fore. Viscerally, I appreciate that the film left me feeling much like I do when I&#8217;m finally getting to bed at 9am after a similar experience. Intellectually, it peered into the lives of some people that would surely be interesting to befriend, but who have a lot standing in their way to happiness.</p>
