<p>Leo and Kate are at it again. I found the “tell the story through flashbacks, but don’t actually have any flashbacks” approach to be a bit difficult to follow at first, but eventually the characters came together and the story built to a nice satisfying emotional punch in the gut. I also loved the crazy mathematician.</p>
