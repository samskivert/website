  <p>A sparkling jewel of a gaming experience. I love the Pikmin! The controls are transparent, the visuals sublime, the soundscape is lush, and one&#8217;s skill develops in perfect time with the difficulty. My dreams are filled with the sights and sounds of Pikmin. I would have no reservations recommending this game to anyone with a pulse and the necessary appendages.</p>
