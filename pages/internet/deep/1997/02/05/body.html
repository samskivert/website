<p> Life as a 
<a href="02.html" target="define"><b>white hat</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">2</font></sup>
isn't easy.  The black hats seem to have all the
time in the world.  They share cracking tools.  They need only find one
vulnerability, while we have to plug them all.  And a significant portion
of the currently deployed network software was not written by the
paranoid.<p>

   Remember when Kevin Mitnick broke into Tsutomu Shimomura's computer at
SDSC, and the whole world got all excited, and John Markoff wrote a book,
and everyone got rich but me? If you weren't following the technical
aspects amidst the drama, that was an IP spoofing attack.  In fact, it was
the first widely reported successful execution of the so-called 
<a href="03.html" target="define"><b>"sequence number attack"</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">3</font></sup>, 
even though it had first been theorized as possible by
<a href="04.html" target="define"><b>Robert T. Morris</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">4</font></sup>
in 1985.<p>

   In this article I'll walk you through the execution of a sequence
number attack.  You should be able to get by with only tenuous knowledge
of IP and TCP, though if those initials ring no bells, you might want to
try something 
<a href="/internet/useless/" target="_blank">less arduous</a>.  
The following abbreviations apply throughout the article: 

<pre>
 [A] -- the trusted host to be spoofed
 [B] -- the target host who is too trusting
 [Q] -- the dastardly attacking host
</pre>

   The 
<a href="05.html" target="define"><b>IP spoofing attack</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">5</font></sup>
is based on exploiting an insecure trust
relationship between two machines.  UNIX users are lazy folk, like all
<a href="06.html" target="define"><b>virtuous</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">6</font></sup> 
techies, and we get annoyed at repeatedly typing the same
passwords.  So we set up time saving devices like .rhosts files, which
allow us an unchallenged login when entering from one or more designated
machines.  Since the determination of where we are coming from is done by
IP address, anyone who can appear as coming from a trusted IP can
compromise the account.<p>

   The source IP address of a packet is set by the originating machine, so
this part is quite simple for [Q].  The difficult part is actually
establishing and carrying out the connection.  To see why, we have to take
a brief look at how TCP/IP works, and how a TCP connection is established
and maintained.<p>

   Consider a typical connection between [A] and [B].  [A] sends a packet
with its SYN bit set and an "initial sequence number" to [B], which
(assuming it is interested in the connection) responds with a packet with
both SYN and ACK bits set, as well as its own initial sequence number. 
Finally [A] ACKs the SYN-ACK packet.  These steps comprise the "3-way
handshake" of TCP.  All subsequent packets in both directions will hold a
sequence number.  These are used to uniquely identify each byte, because
TCP is a "reliable" protocol, meaning that the hosts will re-order packets
received out of order and deliver them as expected.<p>

   Why isn't the initial sequence number always 1, since the TCP
connection is uniquely defined by the source and destination IP addresses
and ports? The reasoning is that packets from an earlier connection with
identical characteristics could still be wandering around the network,
stuck in a routing loop or just relaxing in the Sun.  If one were to
suddenly show up in mid-connection with a valid sequence number,
"reliable" would be a very generous description of TCP.  Instead, the
kernel cycles through a 32-bit range of initial sequence numbers, so many
hours will pass before any are potentially re-used.<p>

   The essential weakness that makes the sequence number attack possible
is that the initial sequence number is <em>predictable</em>. At the time most
TCP/IP stacks were written, there didn't seem to be much need to keep it a
secret.  Further, many of those written after Morris's description of the
vulnerability were still derived from the same original code.<p>

   One difficulty with IP spoofing is that the return packets, starting
with the SYN-ACK sent by the target [B], don't go to our attacker [Q] --
of course, they go to [A].  If a host suddenly sees a SYN-ACK for a
connection it did not attempt to initiate, it will get startled and, in a
panic, send a RST packet to kill the connection.  Obviously this is not in
the interests of the attacker.<p>

   Before the attack can commence, [A] must be prevented from issuing
those RSTs.  This leads us into the interesting area of 
<a href="07.html" target="define"><b>DOS attacks</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">7</font></sup>,
unless the machine in question is running Solaris 2.3 or something
similarly robust, in which case it's probably already down.  There are a
number of ways to crash or completely occupy most UNIX machines -- one
simple one is to send it many SYN packets, and ignore the SYN-ACKS the
machine returns, or forge the source of the SYN packets so the SYN-ACKs
are delivered to a black hole.  Very quickly the target will become unable
to hold any more half-open connections, and start dropping incoming
packets.  This is known as SYN-flooding, and can be a devastating denial
of service attack, as 
<a href="http://www.packet.com/packet/garfinkel/96/43/index2a.html" target="_blank">witnessed by Panix</a> recently.<p>

   Next, [Q] establishes some kind of innocuous connection with [B], such
as connecting to the 
<a href="08.html" target="define"><b>SMTP port</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">8</font></sup>.  [Q] observes the initial sequence
number in the returned SYN-ACK, and because of the predictability of
sequence number generation, it can make a very good guess about what the
initial sequence number of the next connection will be.<p>

   With this newfound knowledge, it now initiates another connection, this
time to the rlogin port of [B], but the source address of its IP packets
is set to that of [A].  Our target [B], blissfully unaware that the real
[A] is busy juggling bogus packets, sends a SYN-ACK which gets lost.  [Q]
never sees the SYN-ACK with the initial sequence number, but waits long
enough to be fairly sure it was sent, then transmits the ACK with the
sequence number it deduced from the SMTP connection.  If the guess is
correct, the 3-way handshake has been completed and data can now be
transferred.  If not, it's time to try again, for crackers are nothing if
not persistent.<p>

   It is rather inconvenient to continue with an ongoing connection when
all the response packets are going into the void, something like trying to
read a 
<a href="09.html" target="define"><b>book</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">9</font></sup> with your eyes tightly closed in the midst of pitch
darkness.  So typically, the attacker now inserts a backdoor into the
system, perhaps again using the "built for security" rlogin system by
modifying .rhosts to allow remote logins from any location.<p>

   IP spoofing can be combatted from a number of directions.  Sequence
number prediction could be made much harder in TCP stacks, but this would
not help protect existing machines.  More simply, if you never trusts
hosts outside the local network, you can use route filtering to make
spoofing impossible.  At go2net, any packets received from the Internet
that claim a source address inside our network are immediately dropped, as
per <a href="10.html" target="define"><b>these cisco rules</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">10</font></sup>:<p>

<pre>
access-list 100 deny   ip 207.178.54.0 0.0.0.255 any log
access-list 100 deny   ip 207.178.55.0 0.0.0.255 any log
</pre>

   There are also much better ways of logging into remote machines using
strong authentication, such as ssh.<p>

   That's about the size of it.  At this point, you're probably wondering
"but what about the great Java code I've come to expect in Deep Magic
articles?" I started writing a cutesy little animated demo with packets
flying to and fro, but decided it didn't really add much value, and
graphics are far from my strength. And then at the last minute, I realized
what I SHOULD have done.  A fully interactive applet with actual operating
hosts, each with sequence number counters and correct reactions (i.e.
unless you disable host [A], it tears down your spoofed connection with an
RST.) So I'll tell you what.  If more than a couple people 
<a href="mailto:paulp@go2net.com">email me</a>
saying "I'd still like to see that, man!" then I'll do it and add it here.<p>

   Until then, don't take any spoofed nickels.<a href="/internet/deep/"
