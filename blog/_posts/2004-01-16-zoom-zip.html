title: "Zoom zip!"
---

  <p>I&#8217;m not sure how things are elsewhere in Asia, but in Japan, people ride their bikes on the sidewalks at very high speeds. Not a day passes when I don&#8217;t have a near-fatal collision with a speeding bicyclist on my way to class. The sidewalks are crowded with people, mind you. I have a hard enough time not bumping into other pedestrians without the zooming chariots of death screaming by periodically. It doesn&#8217;t help that my natural inclination is to veer the wrong way in a pinch. That&#8217;s brought me centimeters from disaster on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>There also seems to be no problem with doing it in the darkness of night. Fortunately, most people have the sense to turn on a headlight of some sort as they come barreling down upon you in excess of 15 miles an hour.</p>
<p>In Rome, I recall a certain sense of &#8220;unease&#8221; when riding in cars with Romans as they would casually slip through  centimeter clearance having spaces without slowing from highway speeds, but as a pedestrian I never felt the sort of terror that I feel on a regular basis strolling down the sidewalks of Japan.</p>
