we had planned to stay overnight for the party, so we did. the next
morning, we were anxious to depart as the whole idea of hanging out much
longer with avi's non-english speaking family was less than appealing.  we
offered to take avi back into town as he had an interview later that
afternoon with a soon to be opening resort. after a whole lot of waiting
around, avi was finally ready to go and we headed out, sure that the whole
affair was behind us. our bright outlook was cut short when avi asked us
to head into another village to pick up his friend who was also
interviewing. we drove high and low through the village looking for his
friend to no avail. so we headed back to the highway and drove toward
nadi.

<p>when we got to nadi, avi wanted to stop by and photocopy his resume, so
we stuck out the midday traffic in nadi and took care of that. then we had
to stop by his house so that he could drop off his laundry and change for
the interview. this would have been a painless affair had i not cleverly
got the car stuck in a ditch on the way into his house. this presented us
with the opportunity to meet many of avi's neighbors and bond with them as
we lifted the car bodily out of the ditch.

<p>we then finally dropped avi off for his interview and headed straight
back to saweni where we relaxed with a beer and made many mental notes not
to be mislead by talk of a party next time we were in a foreign country.

<p>i was apparently so distraught all day that i neglected entirely to
take any pictures. this is too bad because one of the car in the ditch
would have been real handy for looking back and laughing a few years from
now.
