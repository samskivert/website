Have I mentioned how much I love my neighborhood? The kids walking home from school are always blurting out funny things. There are lots of old people sitting around on benches smiling. The station is five minutes away. They are even so kind as to put up banners everywhere expressing my feelings to the world in my native language. What a great place!</p>
