For many software engineers, working with tree-like data structures is a
common pastime. I'm sure we've all sat down to code up a binary or M-ary
tree at one time or another, wondering why on Earth we're rewriting
something we've already written from scratch at least five times before. At
some point
during the coding, most programmers realize they're going to have to
implement (again) another silly
"print-<wbr>the-<wbr>tree-<wbr>out-<wbr>in-<wbr>text-<wbr>so-<wbr>I-<wbr>can-<wbr>see-<wbr>what-<wbr>I'm-<wbr>doing" function. Such
functions are
inherently dissatisfying, due to their poor visual
representation of the data, and programmers invariably end up sketching
their trees with pencil and paper. It's frustrating to have to make the
mental leap between a list of nodes as ASCII text and a nice, clean
graphical representation of the tree's data.
<p>
As some of you probably suspect by now (and many of you know),
there <i>is </i> an alternative!  It turns out that tree-drawing (and
<a href="01.html" target="define"><b>graph-drawing</b></a><sup>1</sup> is a very well-studied problem).  To my
surprise, I discovered that there are entire <a href="http://www.inf.uniroma3.it/calendar/gd97/" target="_blank">conferences</a> dedicated to
the discussion of graph-drawing algorithms and related
research.  There are a variety of interesting, <a href="02.html" target="define"><b>open problems</b></a><sup>2</sup> in the
field of graph drawing (and a number of <a href="03.html" target="define"><b>NP-hard problems</b></a><sup>3</sup> associated
with the issue as well.) If <table width=160 align=left><tr><td><hr size=2 noshade><TT><FONT color="#666666"><B>Some basic porting of C code to Java left me with a Java class enabling

your early-morning shower, look no further.
<p>
I became interested in tree-drawing recently when I needed to
display an M-ary tree in a graphically pleasing manner.  I zipped on over
to <a href="http://www.gamelan.com" target="_blank">Gamelan</a>, expecting to quickly find a suitable pre-written Java
package for displaying trees.  Much to my chagrin, nothing of the sort
existed.  A search on "trees" and "graphs" brought up a variety of
<a href="04.html" target="define"><b>directory tree</b></a><sup>4</sup> classes, some unsuitable 2-D or 3-D graphing classes,
and little else.  In astonishment, I posted a message to
<a href="news://comp.lang.java.programmer">comp.lang.java.programmer</a> asking for assistance.  Most responses
were along the lines of, "Hey, what you're asking for sounds neat!  Why
don't you write a class to draw such trees yourself, and release it
publicly?"  These people missed the point; I wished to make use of the
endangered beast called <a href="http://aazk.ind.net/animal_gifs/Preview/warthog.gif" target="_blank">code re-use</a>, but alas, I found myself playing
the part of the far more common <a href="http://aazk.ind.net/animal_gifs/Preview/mandrill.gif" target="_blank">reimplementation primate</a>.  To aid
others in a similar situation, then, I present herein my initial findings
on the "tidy drawing of trees."
<p>
<B>Quest for trees</B>
<br>
I began my search for information by mucking around in the internals of
the source code to Allan Brighton's <a href="http://arch-http.hq.eso.org/~abrighto/tree/tree.html" target="_blank">Brighton Tree Widget</a> for Tcl/Tk.
The Brighton Tree Widget had proven tremendously useful for my <a href="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/wgg/research.html" target="_blank">research
group's</a> previous work, so porting the existing widget seemed
a likely quick path to success.  As I perused the source, my
<a href="05.html" target="define"><b>eagle-eyes</b></a><sup>5</sup> spotted one of the tastier bread crumbs programmers
occasionally leave behind: a useful comment!  It attributed the
basic tree-drawing algorithm to an <a href="06.html" target="define"><b>article</b></a><sup>6</sup> in the July 1990 issue of
IEEE Software.
<p>
A quick trip to the library, a photocopy of the referenced article, and
some basic porting of<table width=160 align=right><tr><td><hr size=2 noshade><TT><FONT color="#666666"><B>Your tree is one-of-a-kind; be sure to take a screen
snapshot before clearing the tree, else you'll lose your creation forever!
</B></FONT></TT><hr size=2 noshade></td></table> C code to Java left me with a Java class enabling
the <a href="07.html" target="define"><b>beautiful</b></a><sup>7</sup> drawing of M-ary trees.  I present here Java
applet
demonstrations of my tree-drawing code (based on my humbly named
<tt><a href="08.html" target="define"><b>WalTreeCanvas</b></a></tt><sup>8</sup> class) as both a <a href="example1.html" target="_blank">static sample
applet</a> and a more interesting <a href="example2.html" target="_blank">dynamic applet</a>.  Much thanks goes
to <a href="http://www.clarus.se/People/sm/" target="_blank">Sven Moen</a> for writing an eminently understandable article and
bringing together prior research (with his own findings) in a
comprehensive, usable fashion.
<p>
The dynamic applet above allows you to insert your own nodes, creating
your very own <a href="09.html" target="define"><b>tree art</b></a><sup>9</sup>.  Just type the node name into the edit field
and press the "Return" key.  You may clear the currently displayed tree by
clicking the "Clear" button.  The nodes are inserted in random fashion,
as either parent, sibling or child nodes.  The randomness
guarantees that your tree is one-of-a-kind; be sure to take a screen
snapshot before clearing the tree, else you'll lose your creation forever!
For those dissatisfied with the size of the applet display, feel free to
download the code, set your own applet size parameters in the html file,
and run it locally.
<p>
While my implementation isn't quite a clean, abstracted package suitable
for drop-in to any application wishing to display trees, it's an
excellent starting point, and should be usable for many purposes as-is.
Several settings in the <tt>WalTreeCanvas</tt> class
directly affect the display of the tree.  Naturally, the size of
each node (width/height) is crucial; the demonstrations here use the width
of the node label, but a fixed width may also be used (this will also
result in all nodes at the same level in the tree lining up exactly.) The
horizontal position of the root node may be changed; here, it is set just
to the left of the edge.  Finally, the distance between node levels
(the "parent distance") may be changed; the parent distance in my
demos is rather short, to fit more nodes on the display.
<p>
The nodes composing the internal tree structure are represented by the
<tt>WNode</tt> class:
<p>
<pre>
public class WNode {
    String  label;
    WNode   parent, child, sibling;
    int     width, height, border;
    Point   pos, offset;
    Polygon contour;
};
</pre>
<p>
Thus, children of a node are accessed by traversing the child
reference, then proceeding down the linked list of sibling references.
The basic algorithm and further implementation details are described
below.
<p>
<B>Tidy trees
</B>
<br>
Moen's article references two prior ones on tree-drawing; <a href="10.html" target="define"><b>"Tidy
Drawings of Trees"</b></a><sup>10</sup>, and <a href="11.html" target="define"><b>"Tidier Drawings of Trees"</b></a><sup>11</sup>.  In the latter,
Reingold and Tilford detail various requirements for an eye-pleasing
binary tree.  Moen distills these down to five key points:
<p>
<blockquote>
1.  A parent should be drawn above its children.
<p>
2.  Nodes at the same level should lie along a horizontal line.
<p>
3.  A left child should be positioned to the left of its parent and a
right child to the right.
<p>
4.  A tree and its mirror image should be drawn to reflect each other.
<p>
5.  A sub-tree should look the same, regardless of where it occurs.
</blockquote>
<p>
In my applets I wanted a horizontal tree rather than a vertical one, but
the code (and principles) of tree-drawing are equally relevant to both.
The Brighton Tree Widget can draw trees oriented in either direction, but
the WalTree applet cannot now perform such a feat.  Modifying the
code to do so would be relatively simple.
<p>
The basic algorithm for drawing the tree relies on "contours" surrounding
each node, and polygons representing groups of contours.  Nodes are
surrounded by border space, and the contour takes into account both the
node size and border space, representing the overall area, which
should remain empty around the node for pleasant viewing.  The algorithm
then begins by traversing to the leaves of the tree, finding their
contours, and proceeding back up the tree.  At each node, the contours of
the node's children are placed as close together as possible, then
joined into one large polygon. This proceeds up the tree
to the root, calculating the offset distance between each node and its
children along the way.  Once all offsets are calculated, the absolute
positions of the nodes are calculated by beginning with the root node (and
its fixed, known position), and determining the positions of all child
nodes by adding their offsets to the root node's position.  This is called
"planting" the nodes.
<p>
<B>Branching out</B>
<br>
In addition to what I've implemented here, Moen's article describes
an algorithm to allow dynamic updates to the tree; that is, it lets the user
remove or insert nodes and only update the affected sub-tree.  I haven't
implemented this feature due to time
constraints; for those users working with large trees, however, this can
be a valuable addition.
<p>
Tree-drawing algorithms may substitute for graph-drawing ones in
certain circumstances.  This can be advantageous, as the runtime of the
algorithm presented here is O(n), and many graph-drawing algorithms take
time O(n<SUP>2</SUP>).  For further information, Roberto Tamassia has
an excellent <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/rt/gd.html" target="_blank">web page</a> on graph drawing, containing information (or
links to information) on most everything pertaining to the area.
<p>
<tt>System.out.println()</tt> drives everyone nuts eventually,
and it's clear that excellent alternatives are available.
Hopefully, the references and implementation described here will be of
help the next time you find yourself wishing for a more appealing view of
your tree-structured data.  Of course, there's always paper and pencil to
fall back on, but there's little doubt that road leads inevitably to
<a href="12.html" target="define"><b>ruin</b></a><sup>12</sup>.
