<p>London in the eighties was apparently indulging in fashion that was just as embarassing as we were doing here in the colonies. In spite of being a bit hard to follow at times, this film gets into some meaty subject matter in the form of the love affair between a (male) white trash London punk kid and the son of a Pakistani immigrant who endured some pretty substantial racial hatred, some of which came from his now lover. This one also has some iffy production values, but not nearly as bad as <cite>Atanarjuat</cite>.
