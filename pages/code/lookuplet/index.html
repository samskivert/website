<h3>What is it?</h3>

<p> <img src="images/lookuplet.png" align="right"> lookuplet provides
  an easily accessible, unified interface for looking things up. There
  are many applications (desktop and web-based) in which you enter
  some text and they return some information based on that
  text. Examples include:

<ul>
  <li> Looking a word up in a dictionary
  <li> Performing a web search
  <li> Performing a more specific search (searching Debian packages or
    on freshmeat.net, etc.)
  <li> Looking up an address in a mapping service
</ul>

<p> lookuplet aims to make all of those services readily accessible in
  as efficient a manner as possible.

<p> When invoked, the lookuplet grabs the current selection and sticks
  it into a text field for potential editing. You then press a key
  combination that you have previously configured and the text is sent
  either as an argument to an application or URL encoded and
  substituted into a URL which is then opened with your preferred web
  browser.

<p> This interface is based on the emacs principle of typing as few
  characters as possible to perform tasks that are done frequently. I
  find myself looking things up in various applications all of the
  time and the overhead of creating a new browser window, selecting a
  bookmark, clicking into the text entry field, entering the text and
  then pressing submit struck me as tremendously inefficient.

<p> The expectation is that you'll configure your window manager to
  launch lookuplet at the press of some key combination so that from
  any application, you can simply highlight text, press the lookuplet
  key combination and then press the key combination of your desired
  service.  With such a configuration, the process of looking up
  information becomes extremely efficient in terms of key presses and
  mouse clicks.

<p> The key combinations used by lookuplet and the associated launch
  configuration are maintained via a simple graphical user interface.
