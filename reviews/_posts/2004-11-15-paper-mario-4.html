  <p>Another superb production from Intelligent Systems. Since Advance Wars, these guys have been giving Miyamoto and company strong competition for position as my favorite developer. Excellent writing (surviving translation, no less), an entertaining plot, superb visuals, wit and nostalgia, fun game mechanics, it&#8217;s everything a boy could want (and a girl if she grew up playing Mario games).</p>
