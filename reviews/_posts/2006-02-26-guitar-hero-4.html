	<p>I’ve only made it part way through hard mode, but I’ll add my voice to the choir that has been singing the praises of Guitar Hero from all corners. I haven’t had this much fun with a rhythm game since Parappa. The satisfaction of pulling off a complicated solo, hearing the crowd go wild and collapsing exhaustedly as the game proudly proclaims that “You Rock!” is among the choicest in video gaming.
