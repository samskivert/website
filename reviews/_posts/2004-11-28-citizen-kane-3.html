  <p>Everyone said it was a fantastic movie and indeed I thoroughly enjoyed it. I&#8217;m perhaps not enough of a film-geek to have appreciated all the technical details, but it was nice to be reminded that there was a time in American history when we all (pardon my naivete) embraced a bit more rough and ready idealism.</p>
