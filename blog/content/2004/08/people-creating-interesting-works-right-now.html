  <p>I was recently thinking about how the sum total of people in history who had the ability to create works of art that might impact my life compares to the sum total of people alive today that have the ability to create works of art that might impact my life. I think the former is indeed a much smaller group and yet they are so much more well known. Thus I decided that I should do my part to spread the word about people that <a href="http://samskivert.com/misc/greatness.html">I think are achieving greatness</a> in this very day and age.</p>
