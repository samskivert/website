  <p>Tile laying fun for the whole family. One of the vast pantheon of German games, <cite>Carcassonne</cite> involves connecting tiles together and claiming features created by the placed tiles (roads, cities, cloisters and farms). Though complex strategies are difficult to devise and even more difficult to test, the game moves quickly and choosing which basic strategies to employ given the behavior of your opponents proves to be challenge enough. Another bonus is that the game play is such that it&#8217;s fun in both casual and competitive environments.</p>
