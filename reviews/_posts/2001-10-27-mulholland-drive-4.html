  <p>If David Lynch had a horn, I&#8217;d toot it (get your mind out of that gutter mister). Another masterfully done film from one of my favorite directors. My friend Vic characterized Lynch&#8217;s films aptly by stating that they are like M.C. Escher&#8217;s work; every detail of the pictures fits seamlessly and elegantly but if you try to piece them together, you discover that they form an impossible whole. <cite>Mulholland Drive</cite> scores highly on elegance as well as impossibility, and is saturated with Lynch&#8217;s inimitable dark style. Plus it has hot girl on girl action. Who could ask for more?</p>
