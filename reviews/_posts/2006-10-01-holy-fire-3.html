<p>Sterling was sort of sucked off my reading list in the wake of the giant crater left by everything Gibson wrote after Neuromancer. It seems that he was off writing about life extension and its post human consequences, and weaving it all into an engaging tale. A page turning story, and interesting in that it doesnâ€™t involve nanotech. On the downside, the title and the way in which it factors into the story are a little annoying.
