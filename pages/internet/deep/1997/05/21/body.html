"Object-oriented" is well on its way to becoming part of that elite group
of phrases that make you want to <a href="01.html"
target="define"><b>depart from a conversation</b></a><sup>1</sup> as soon
as possible, no matter how attractive the participants. What it is that
drives a phrase into ubiquitious buzzword-dom I cannot say, but if you
could bottle it and sell it, Steve Jobs would have picked up a truckload
about five years ago and started shoving the topic of this article down
everyone's throat.

Enough with obscure references; what I'm talking about here are
distributed objects. In a nutshell, a distributed object is like a <a
href="02.html" target="define"><b>regular object</b></a><sup>2</sup>,

<table width=180 align=right>
<tr><td width=10><br></td><td><br><hr size=1><b><tt><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="ARIAL"><I>I'll limit my endeavors this week

</table>

only it is shared between processes on a machine or <a href="03.html"
target="define"><b>processes on different
machines</b></a><sup>3</sup>. Like object-oriented programming, this
relatively simple concept can prove to be a very useful way to organize
one's applications.

<p><b>Deep objects and distributed magic</b><br>

What better way to introduce the topic of distributed objects than to <a
href="04.html" target="define"><b>implement a distributed-object
system</b></a><sup>4</sup>? Since I don't exactly have time to write a
full-fledged, general-purpose distributed-object system -- and I certainly
don't have time to explain one in detail -- I'll limit my endeavors this
week to creating a distributed-object system with the ability to do
something <a href="05.html" target="define"><b>actually
exciting</b></a><sup>5</sup> in next week's article.

The architecture of this system is relatively simple. A server runs on a
machine (the one that served you this article, in fact) and manages all
the objects. Clients connect to that machine and register as subscribers
to those objects. Whenever a change is made to an object (by any of the
clients or by code running as part of the server), an attribute-changed
event is broadcast to all the subscribers of that object. The clients
automatically update their local representations of the object and
broadcast the attribute-changed event to any local subscribers.

<p>Let's take a look at some excerpts of the code for a clearer
understanding of what all this means:

<pre>
public class DObject
{
    public int getValue (String name, int def);
    public void setValue (String name, int value)
        throws IOException;

    public String getValue (String name, String def);
    public void setValue (String name, String value)
        throws IOException;

   // getting and setting arrays of int and arrays
   // of String is also available
}
</pre>

Since we don't yet have support for <a
href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.1/docs/guide/reflection/spec/java-reflectionTOC.doc.html" target="_blank">Java Object Reflection</a> the
DObject has to provide specialized member-functions for getting and
setting values. When a value is set, it automatically informs its local
object manager (described below), who takes care of sending
attribute-changed events to the appropriate parties.

<pre>
public class Event
{
    public final static byte OBJECT_CREATED = 0;
    public final static byte OBJECT_DELETED = 1;
    public final static byte ATTR_CHANGED = 2;

    public byte type;
    public String oid;
    public String name;
    public Object value;
}

public interface Subscriber
{
    public boolean handleEvent (DObject target,
                                Event evt);
}
</pre>

<p>When a change occurs to a DObject attribute, an event is delivered to
all subscribers of that object. In order to get a reference to a DObject,
one must name a subscriber to be notified when changes occur to that
object. The subscriber can respond accordingly to the attribute
changes. This system is used by users of the distributed-object system as
well as internally, to facilitate the distribution of attribute-changed
events.

<pre>
public interface DObjectManager
{
    public void attributeChanged (DObject object,
        String name, Object value)
        throws IOException;

    public DObject subscribeToObject (String oid,
        Subscriber sub) throws IOException;

    public void destroyObject (String oid)
        throws IOException;
    public void dispatchEvent (Event evt)
        throws IOException;<br>
}
</pre>

<p>The last major piece of the puzzle is the object manager, which is
where objects are obtained. It handles all the event-dispatch
details. DObjects are obtained from the object manager and it is also used
to destroy objects.

<p><b>The hairy details</b><br>

I'll try to <a href="06.html"
target="define"><b>quickly</b></a><sup>6</sup> describe the mechanism by
which attribute-changed events get properly passed to all subscribers of
an object (both local and remote), but don't fret if this gets a little
hairy. After all, it's just implementation detail.

<p>There are two implementations of DObjectManager (notice that it is only
an interface), one for the server and one for the client. All DObjects
have a reference to the object manager. When the user calls any of the
setValue (or related) member functions, the DObject notifies the
DObjectManager that one of its attributes has been changed. The server
object manager turns this notification into an attribute-changed event and
broadcasts that event to all registered subscribers of that DObject.

<p>If life were limited to the single-server process, this would
suffice. However, a similar implementation in the client DObjectManager
would not work. It would only broadcast attribute-changed events to local
subscribers of a Dobject, not the potential multitude of other
client-subscribers connected to the server. So every client maintains a
proxy subscriber in the server process. When the client DObjectManager
gets a subscribe request, it sends a message to its proxy in the server,
asking it to subscribe to the object. The server proxy then <a
href="07.html" target="define"><b>marshals </b></a><sup>7</sup> the object
and sends it down to the client. The client DObjectManager keeps that
object around in a hash table for other potential local subscribers to
use.

<p>Now, whenever an attribute-change event happens at the server, it will
be sent to this client's subscriber proxy, who will forward the event to
the client. The client can then distribute the attribute-changed event to
all local subscribers. Conversely, when the client DObjectManager

</table>

receives an attribute-change notification from one of its local objects,
it does not send it to the subscribers of that object, but forwards it to
the subscriber proxy, who makes the same change to the server-object
instance. This causes the server to generate an attribute-changed event
and forward it to all of that object's subscribers (local and remote). As
a consequence of that event, all the subscribers local to the client will
eventually receive the attribute change, the same round-a-bout way that
all the other clients received it. This also helps to equalize
event-delivery timing.

<p>If you want to know more, you'll have to take a look at the source.

<p><b>The token application</b><br>

If you can remember all the way back to the beginning of the article, I
mentioned something about using this to write something cool. Well, that's
not going to happen now. I'm saving that for next week. So instead, I'm
going to implement a lame little chat system, then go back to doing real
work.

<p>If any of this made sense, you might have a clue as to what the
implementation is going to look like. I can sum it up for you in these two
code fragments:

<pre>
// send a chat message to everyone
String message = _name + ": " +  _text.getText();
_cobj.setValue("message", message);

// update our message display when a
// new message arrives
public boolean handleEvent (Event evt)
{
    if ((evt.type == Event.ATTR_CHANGED) &amp;&amp;
        evt.oid.equals("chat_object") &amp;&amp;
        evt.name.equals("message")) {
        _msgbuffer.appendText((String)evt.value+"\n");
    }
    return true;
}
</pre>

That and a little user-interface code are all that are necessary to
implement a chat system (a very simple and not terribly efficient one, but
who's counting?)

chat are easy to do with distributed objects.  <a href="/internet/deep/"
