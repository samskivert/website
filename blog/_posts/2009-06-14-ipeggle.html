<p>I discovered recently that Peggle is available on the iPhone for $1 and I am simply appalled. I don’t know what to think about a universe where one can obtain, for a single US dollar, a quantity of awesome in proportions so epic as to tax the imagination. It spits in the face of the very notion of value. Next they’ll be selling Ferraris for $7.50 and caviar for $.25 a pound. The singularity must be nigh.</p>
