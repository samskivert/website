  <p>Another thoughtful work from an author who is putting the science back into science fiction. Egan has a knack for weaving numerous intellectually stimulating ideas into a coherent framework with a bit of dramatic plot to boot. I&#8217;m glad he further explored, in <cite>Diaspora</cite>, the seeds of ideas planted in <cite>Permutation City</cite> and, given the choice, I would have read the latter first.</p>
