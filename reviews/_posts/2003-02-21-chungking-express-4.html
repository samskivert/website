  <p>Wong Kar Wai is the mack daddy! Oh wait, I think I said that the last time I reviewed one of his movies. He&#8217;s just the right combination of hopeless romantic, inimitable style and Amelie-style wackiness (more than a decade before Amelie, I might add). I want to see his movies again and again.</p>
