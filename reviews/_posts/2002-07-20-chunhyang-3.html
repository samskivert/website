  <p>This film introduced me to pansori &#8212; a sort of Korean solo opera &#8212; and Cho Sang-hyun in particular, who was absolutely brilliant. The story was excellently told, with brilliant sets and costumes. A sterling movie watching experience if you&#8217;re into classic tales and exotic sounds.</p>
