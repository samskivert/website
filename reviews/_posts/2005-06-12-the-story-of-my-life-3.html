  <p>Hellen Keller was no doubt an amazing person. That she developed an ability to communicate so richly, and make proper use of such a variety of adjectives that were by definition wholly outside the realm of her life experience says something about the universality of the human condition. Otherwise it&#8217;s just a fairly interesting story of a girl growing up at the turn of the century who had an enthusiasm for life. I do suspect that she was secretly getting some action from her teacher but her sense of propriety (and a lack of knowledge of <em>that</em> vocabulary) kept even the slightest innuendo from slipping into her story.</p>
