  <p>When I was little, I would feel sad when I finished a book, knowing that I would never hear more about those fascinating people and their adventures. At some point this melancholy sort of faded away; probably not long after reading became homework. Somehow in the maelstrom of Murakami&#8217;s rhythmic words, nostalgic themes and total disregard for the expected, the little me is lured back to the fireside to hear the tale. And he&#8217;s very sad when the story&#8217;s over.</p>
