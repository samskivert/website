  <p>I admit to not having read any of Virgina Woolf&#8217;s works, <cite>Mrs. Dalloway</cite> included, but that probably worked to my advantage as I could take the filmmaker&#8217;s presentation at face value rather than pitting it against my own feelings and thoughts about the author and her works. Sure it&#8217;s probably not historically accurate, but what do I care? I&#8217;m having more fun experiencing the life of the author, some random woman, her son, and the woman he calls Mrs. Dalloway, wrapped up into some package of dramatic entertainment than I&#8217;m likely to ever get out an authentic biography. I can only hope that someone pays me the same compliment long after I&#8217;m dead.</p>
