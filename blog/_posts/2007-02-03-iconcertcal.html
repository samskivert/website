<p>This thing is so awesome! It’s a plugin for iTunes (a visualizer) that scans your music library and then looks for upcoming shows by anyone whose music you own. Within seconds of installing it, I found out about four great shows that I would have never thought to look for. I didn’t even have to tell it I was in San Francisco. It magically figured that out from my IP address. It would be even cooler if it just exported this data in iCal format so that I could integrate it with my regular calendar. Huge props to Jonathan for the pointer.
