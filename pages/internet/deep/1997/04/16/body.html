<p>Various and sundry little <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.wins.uva.nl/~mes/jargon/d/displayhack.html">display
hacks</a> are floating around in the collective knowledge of computer
scientists everywhere. Some are found in signatures, others are tucked
deeply into the twisted folds of entries in the <a target="_blank"
href="http://reality.sgi.com/csp/ioccc/index.html">IOCCC</a>, countless
others are undoubtedly languishing in anonymity on some lonely hard
drive. This week I've put together a collection of interesting graphics
hacks I've encountered in various
situations. Some I've only seen and had to reverse-engineer; some are from
screen savers; others have just managed to ooze into my memory by osmosis.

<p>I've tried to boil them down to their very essence for presentation in
this article. To that extent, I present the core of the algorithm for your
perusal in the text, and I've tried to encapsulate all the system-specific
stuff into simple calls from that algorithm. The real source is only a
click away, so feel free to peruse that if you feel something is not quite
clear from the code excerpt. Without further ado, I present hacks:

<p><b>Bent over backward</b>

<br>First, we'll warm up with something easy. If you haven't seen this
one, you shouldn't have much trouble figuring out what it's going to do
from a glance at the <a href="Grid.java" target="source">code</a>.

<pre>
for (int x = 0, y = 0; x &lt; width;
  x += width/LINES, y += height/LINES) {
  drawLine(0, y, x, height);
  drawLine(width, height-y, width-x, 0);
}
</pre>

<p>Now that you've visualized it, take a look at the <a href="01.html"
target="define"><b>real thing</b></a><sup>1</sup>. Pretty cute, isn't it.

<p><b>Hey, I've got curtains like that!</b>

<br>Now we'll break out the tried-and-true tool of <a href="02.html"
target="define"><b>recursion</b></a><sup>2</sup>. <a href="Deco.java"
target="source">This one</a> is no head-scratcher, but it sure looks cool.

<pre>
void deco (int x, int y, int w, int h, int depth)
{
  if ((random(MAXDEPTH) &gt; depth) || (w &lt; 8) || (h &lt; 8)) {
    drawRectangle(x, y, w, h, _colors[random(COLORS)]);

  } else {
    if (random(100) &gt; 50) {
      deco(x, y, w/2, h, depth-1);
      deco(x+w/2, y, w/2, h, depth-1);
    } else {
      deco(x, y, w, h/2, depth-1);
      deco(x, y+h/2, w, h/2, depth-1);
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>It all starts with one call like so:

<pre>
deco(0, 0, width, height, MAXDEPTH);
</pre>

<p>Got it figured out yet? If you don't associate the `70s with some sort
of bad experience, you should be able to fully appreciate this hack. Go
ahead and have a look at <a href="03.html" target="define"><b>the
output</b></a><sup>3</sup>. Clicking on the applet will cause it to
generate <a href="04.html" target="define"><b>different
output</b></a><sup>4</sup>.

<p><b>The Golden Spiral</b>

<br>Ok, enough with the easy stuff. Here's something that's just plain
non-intuitive. Definitely evaluate the loop by hand a few times and figure
out what the code is doing, because it will be all the more pleasing when
you actually see what is displayed. To clarify, the drawCircle() function
call takes an x coordinate, a y coordinate, a diameter and a color. Don't
worry about the fact that the size of the circle is increasing as the loop
iterates, though; this is just for effect and isn't crucial to the
<a href="Spiral.java" target="source">algorithm</a>.

<pre>
double GOLDEN_NUMBER = (Math.sqrt(5.0)-1.0)/2.0;
double GOLDEN_ANGLE  = 2*Math.PI * (1.0-GOLDEN_NUMBER);

double side = (double)Math.min(width, height), th = 0.0;
for (double r = 0.05; r &lt; 0.5; r += 0.001) {
  drawCircle((int)(r * Math.sin(th) * side) + width/2,
             (int)(r * Math.cos(th) * side) + height/2,
             Math.max(side / 25.0 * Math.sqrt(r), 1.0),
             colors[(int)(r * 2 * (double)COLORS)]);
  th = th + GOLDEN_ANGLE;
}
</pre>

<p>If you think you know what's going to happen, <a href="05.html"
target="define"><b>find out</b></a><sup>5</sup> if you're right. This
unexpected multiple-spiral effect is the result of the carefully chosen <a
href="06.html" target="define"><b>angle of
increment</b></a><sup>6</sup>. If this pattern looks familiar to you, it
should. It is the same pattern made by sunflower seeds as they grow on a
sunflower. (Consequently, that is the motivation for the slowly increasing
radii of the circles, to simulate the growth of the sunflower seed.) The
golden mean is a fascinating topic, and much better <a target="_blank"
href="http://galaxy.cau.edu/tsmith/kw/golden.html">introductions</a> to
the subject have been put together than I could present here.

<p><b>Circular interference</b>

<br>To make up for the density of that last hack, this next one is nice
and sparse. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), that doesn't mean its
results are any less interesting. This one, too, benefits from a close
scrutiny of the code. Since the colors <em>are</em> important this time,
I'll let you in on what is not explicitly shown in the code excerpt: The
variable <code>colors</code> is an array of Color objects that are spread
through the color spectrum to achieve a smooth transition from red to
green to blue, back to red. The constant <code>COLORS</code> is the number
of colors in the array (in this case, 64). Finally, the
<code>drawPixel()</code> function takes a Color object as its first
argument and draws the pixel in that color. So now that you've got <a
href="Circles.java" target="source">the details</a>, try to figure out
what's going to happen.

<pre>
int factor = random(10) + 1;
for (int y = 0; y &lt; height; y++) {
  for (int x = 0; x &lt; width; x++) {
    drawPixel(colors[((x*x+y*y)/factor) % COLORS], x, y);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Not sure what in the heck is going on? <a href="07.html"
target="define"><b>Find out.</b></a><sup>7</sup> If you click the mouse in
the applet, it will choose a different random divisor and regenerate the
display. Try it a couple of times. Knowing the divisor is chosen to be a
random integer from 1 to 10 should clue you in to what's going on at the
primary level. That still doesn't explain the crazy interference patterns.

<p><b>Pixel-elation</b>

<br>This last one is a little longer than the others, but I think it still
fares well enough by the <a href="08.html" target="define"><b>display hack
metric</b></a><sup>8</sup>. If you're worn out from deciphering the
previous hacks, then it's all right if you skip <a target="source"
href="Plasma.java">the analysis</a> this one time.

<pre>
final static int[] _scale = { 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, 18 };

int mutate (int value, int depth)
{
  return (value + random(_scale[depth]) -
          _scale[depth]/2 + COLORS) % COLORS;
}

int avg2 (int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1)
{
  return (getPixel(x0, y0) + getPixel(x1, y1))/2;
}

int avg4 (int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1)
{
  return (getPixel(x0, y0) + getPixel(x0, y1) +
          getPixel(x1, y0) + getPixel(x1, y1))/4;
}

for (int depth = 6; depth >= 0; --depth) {
  for (int y = 0; y < SIZE; y += (1 << depth)) {
    int ny = y + (1 << depth), hy = y + (1 << depth)/2;
    for (int x = 0; x < SIZE; x += (1 << depth)) {
      int nx = x + (1 << depth), hx = x + (1 << depth)/2;
      setPixel(mutate(avg2(x, y, nx, y), depth), hx, y);
      setPixel(mutate(avg2(x, y, x, ny), depth), x, hy);
      setPixel(mutate(avg4(x, y, nx, ny), depth), hx, y);
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Have a look at this final example's <a href="09.html"
target="define"><b>output</b></a><sup>9</sup>. Pretty keen eh? In case you
didn't figure it out for yourself, what's going on here is that the four
corners of the square are filled with random colors. Then the color of
each point halfway between those four corners (and the center point) is
set to the average of the colors of the points it's between.

<p>The catch is that it's not exactly the average. The color is mutated a
little bit away from the exact average. In the first iteration, it has the
possibility of being mutated a lot, however as we splice the squares
further and further, the range of mutation becomes smaller and smaller. By
the time we're mutating pixels that are right next to each other, the
mutation range is down to one. So no two neighboring pixels have a sharp
color difference.

<p><b>E pluribus unix</b>

<br>I've put together a few interesting graphics hacks for your scrutiny
and appreciation; hopefully, you've found them at least mildly
enjoyable. So now I want you to pitch in and send me any of those clever
little hacks you once saw and tucked away in a file for safekeeping. I'll
put them together in subsequent articles like this one and everyone can
read them and be amused. Don't worry if they're not written in Java, or
even if they're not graphics hacks. I can take care of translating them
into a Web-presentable format. Also, if you can point me toward a
definitive author for anything you send in, that would be great; but I'd
much rather have things unattributed than incorrectly attributed.

<p>Happy hacking. <a href="/internet/deep/" target="_top"><img
