<h3>What is it?</h3>

<p> Who, Where, When is a web application I wrote back in 2001 when I
was traveling frequently and so were my friends. I wanted to make sure
we didn't unknowingly miss a chance to cross paths in a foreign land.

<p> These days, it's pretty much rendered obsolete by
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/">calendar
sharing</a>, which is way more general purpose anyway. So I make the
source available simply because it's there.

<h3>Take Your Chances</h3>

<p> Heck, it's probably still running, so you can
<a href="/whowhere/">try it out</a> if you want to see how it works.

<h3>Source</h3>

<p> The source is on Github:
