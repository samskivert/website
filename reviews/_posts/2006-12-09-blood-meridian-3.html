<p>A gritty, allegorical tale of a kid striking out on his own and falling in with a band of ruthless but colorful characters who spend most of their time murdering Indians and cashing in their scalps. McCarthy uses such extraordinary language throughout the book, I can’t do better than quote another reviewer who characterizes it as “biblical.”
