	<p>A well told story of a guy with a psychotic wife, a mentally deficient brother, a recently dead father and a growing desire to sleep with his housekeeper. As a part of the Dogme95 project, this was all done without props, makeup, soundtrack, computers, dollies, or directorial credit. A bit ascetic, to be sure, but the movie turned out well.
