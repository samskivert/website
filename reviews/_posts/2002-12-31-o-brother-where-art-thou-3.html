  <p>A fine adventure with great musical accompaniment. Having seen <cite>Down from the mountain</cite> and the original performers of the music in this film before seeing the film, it was a bit strange seeing the music come out of different mouths. See them in the proper order if you&#8217;re faced with the choice. Glad to see Turturro in a good role after having suffered through <cite>The Luzhin Defence</cite>.</p>
