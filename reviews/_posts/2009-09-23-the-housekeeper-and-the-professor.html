<p>A poignant story about a housekeeper, her son and a professor of mathematics who can no longer form long-term memories. It’s told with a quiet poetry and an enthusiasm for math and baseball. I couldn’t help thinking frequently about what it would be like to be on either side of that equation.</p>
