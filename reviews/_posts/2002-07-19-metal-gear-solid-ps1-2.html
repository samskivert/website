  <p>For the so-called &#8220;greatest console game ever,&#8221; I found MGS to be not to my liking. I suppose I don&#8217;t much go for the running around and shooting things (or trying to avoid being shot as the case may be), but even the plot and voice acting left a lot to be desired. The game only serves to strongly emphasize how far off the mark game developers are when it comes to creating a compelling dramatic experience. I&#8217;m not saying that the industry should stick to abstract, puzzly games, rather that designers need to learn to be better story tellers and better &#8220;screen&#8221; writers. MGS feels like a poorly conceived Schwarzenneger film; when the industry produces games that feel like a film by Lynch or Cronenberg, then we&#8217;ll truly have arrived.</p>
