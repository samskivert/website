  <p>Oe tells a stark tale of life in wartime Japan through the eyes of a reform school boy and his mates. Not having lived in Japan in the fifties, I suspect there was a great deal of symbolism and social commentary that largely slipped over my head, but the mood and themes still made for an enjoyable reading experience.</p>
