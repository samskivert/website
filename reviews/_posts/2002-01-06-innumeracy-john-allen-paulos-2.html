  <p>Though the subject matter is near and dear to my heart and the topics were well conceived, Paulos was often distractingly abrasive in his recommended &#8220;solutions&#8221; to the problems of innumeracy. I can&#8217;t help but feel that he spends too little time with non-mathematicians; the lack of perspective from which dilutes his well intentioned message. One&#8217;s time is better spent reading Martin Gardner or Carl Sagan.</p>
