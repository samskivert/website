  <p>Outstanding! Between Stan Lee, David Koepp and Sam Raimi, a great story has grown from a small collection of ideas into an entertainment experience that truly deserves the label of blockbuster. Excellently cast, with a nice balance between action and character development, <cite>Spider-Man</cite> is a rare example of Hollywood actually turning out something worth watching.</p>
