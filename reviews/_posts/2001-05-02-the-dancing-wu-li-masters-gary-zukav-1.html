  <p>As a math-free explanation of the basics of quantum mechanics and related developments in physics over the last century, <i>The Dancing Wu Li Masters</i> fares reasonably well in my limited experience with the subject. However, this reasonable explanation is peppered with wildly off-base comparisons of quantum phenomena to Eastern mysticism. I don&#8217;t deny that at a vague and very surface level, parallels can be drawn, but those analogies fail to bear the fruit of deeper understanding of either subject. Not only that, but he presents them with an enthusiasm that reeks of faith not science. Look elsewhere to learn about quantum mechanics.</p>
