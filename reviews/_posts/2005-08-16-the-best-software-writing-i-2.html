  <p>Some of the essays were moderately entertaining or informative (particularly one or two that I had already read on the Interweb), but most of them were lacking. Further, Joel&#8217;s little introductions and &#8220;helpful&#8221; footnotes were annoying. I&#8217;m a fan of a lot of <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">his writing</a>, but he doesn&#8217;t cut it as an editor.</p>
