<h3>What is it?</h3>

<p> Jikan is a calendaring and list management tool that works the way
I want, rather than the way everyone else in the world seems to think
that such tools should work. Specifically:

<ul>
  <li><p> The calendar shows the current and upcoming weeks rather
  than giving me a pointless week or month view which become
  increasingly useless toward the end of the time period in question.

  <li><p> My appointments are shown in a list so I can see the next
  ten or so appointments regardless of how far into the future they
  are. Additional appointments are just a button click away.

  <li><p> It has support for a daily journal wherein I keep track of
  stuff I did. Some people probably aren't this anal, but I find it to
  be interesting and useful. Even more so when I eventually add
  searching support.

  <li><p> It's data can be shared between computers by instructing
  Jikan to store its files in your
  <a href="http://getdropbox.com">Dropbox</a> folder (or any other
  magically mirrored directory). Jikan will detect when files are
  updated and reload things appropriately. I regularly have it running
  on at least three computers.

  <li><p> It syncs your appointments out to a Google Calendar. At some
  point I'm going to implement bi-directional syncing, but for now if
  you create (or update) an appointment in Jikan it will get written
  out to your Google Calendar (assuming you log into your Google
  account when it starts up).
</ul>

I've been using it for half a decade or so and find it to be pretty
functional. A few things to note:

<ul>
  <li><p> Right click on a date to create a new blank appointment
  entry for that date. Then edit the appointment below to fill in the
  details.

  <li><p> The date and time parsing code is fiddly. You have to enter
  in "HH:MM xM" exactly or it will fail to parse. In the future, I'm
  going to write a graphical widget for setting the date and time.

  <li><p> Right click on list items to delete them. Events do not
  automatically expire after they have passed, you have to manually
  delete them. Perhaps someday I'll automatically archive them in the
  journal.

  <li><p> It used to also have categorized TODO lists but I nixed
  those in favor of using separate TODO software. Jikan now focuses on
  maintaining appointments that have a date and time and on recording
  a journal of your daily activities.
</ul>
