  <p>I worried that this film would be a giant disappointment, forever tainting my memories of the pure joy of reading the books. Not surprisingly, it failed to capture the falling out of your chair hilarity of its written counterpart, but it wasn&#8217;t half bad. I really liked the goofy flash-animated excerpts from the guide, they would provide a great foundation for an entirely different film that incorporated the guide but didn&#8217;t have the giant albatross of an unsurpassably hilarious written source holding it back from true greatness.</p>
