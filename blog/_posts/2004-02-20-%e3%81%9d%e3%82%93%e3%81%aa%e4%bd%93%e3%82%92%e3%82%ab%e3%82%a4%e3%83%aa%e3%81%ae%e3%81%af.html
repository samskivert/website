  <p>As my local supermarket is on my way home from school, I actually go there about twice a week &#8212; a vast improvement from my San Francisco schedule which was more like once every two months.</p>
<p>For the last four weeks or so, next to the checkout stands, a little TV has been playing this ad for a new drink. Over, and over, and over again. The ad isn&#8217;t more than twenty seconds long and it&#8217;s a catchy little tune sung while a man with a little frog hat on hops up some stairs. I don&#8217;t entirely understand the words but it&#8217;s something about &#8220;having a body like this&#8221; (ie. having a frog head).</p>
<p>Japanese supermarkets are noisy places because nearly every aisle has some recorded voice telling you at high volume about some good deal or other. They seem to have a higher tolerance for noise pollution around here. So as to be clearly heard, this little jingle was playing nice and loud.</p>
<p>The first time I heard it, I thought it was cute, but I was relieved when I finally made it through the line at the checkout stand. When it was still playing the next week, I developed a greater respect for the stoic cashiers who tolerated this twenty second auditory virus, over and over again, non-stop, all day, every day. By the third week, I wept at the humanity of it all and was very careful to be nice to the cashiers for fear that they might snap and start beating anyone in arm&#8217;s reach with the drawer of their cash register.</p>
<p>On the fourth week, I was relieved to discover that even the iron will of the Japanese has a limit and that they had turned the volume down.</p>
