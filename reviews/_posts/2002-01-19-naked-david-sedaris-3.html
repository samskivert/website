  <p>Don&#8217;t read this book in the company of other people. The first few times you burst into laughter, they may smile up at you with an inquisitive look, hoping to hear a short excerpt that gives them cause to do a bit of giggling themselves. The fiftieth time you do so is more likely to result in their carving out your tongue with the nearest sharp object. Fortunately, I was reading this at an airport, where every sharp object larger than a thumbtack had been scrupulously removed by the security personnel on the way in. If you enjoy humor that is as darkly twisted as it is sharp-witted, your sides are guaranteed to be hurting after the first chapter.</p>
