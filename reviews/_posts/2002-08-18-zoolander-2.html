  <p>A silly movie with a few cheap laughs and another misstep by Owen Wilson. I&#8217;d like to blame this one on Mr. Korman, but I know by now not to watch a film solely on his recommendation. I suppose that I can at least take consolation in having had the good sense not to see it on the big screen.</p>
