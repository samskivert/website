  <p>Having finally gotten to the point with <cite>Age of Empires: II</cite> that I could compete sufficiently well with my friends that I actually had fun, I was wary of the prospect of taking the pain all over again to learn a whole new set of tactics and counter-tactics. I can&#8217;t say that I got completely over the hump, but I think I got back to the point where I was actually having fun rather than being annoyed at the inhumanity of it all after spending multiple hours of uninterrupted concentration looking down the business end of a crushing army. None the less, I&#8217;m of the opinion that modern RTSs have become more of a lifestyle decision than a genre and one with a level of commitment that runs counter to my polygamorous inclinations.</p>
