<p>It’s a pleasure to read Hofstadter again, with his wacky dreamt up dialogues and penchant for punnery. However, this book was fairly tightly focused on a single issue — one that I was on board with after the first hundred pages or so. I much preferred the vast sweeping intellectual adventure that was <cite>GEB</cite>, the more technical exposition of <cite>Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies</cite> or even the way out in left field (even for Hofstadter) musings on poetry translation in <cite>Le Ton Beau De Marot</cite>. Still, it’s good to see him back in the saddle.</p>
