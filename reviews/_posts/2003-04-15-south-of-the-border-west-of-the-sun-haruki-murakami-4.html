  <p>Another wistful tale from my new favorite author. He&#8217;s making it difficult for me to read anyone else, so graceful is the flow of his narrative, so tragic are his characters, nostalgic are his settings, well chosen are his words (or at least his translators&#8217;). His novels are literary nourishment as I make the transition from youth to adulthood; like a superb meal, they bring a deeply satisfying, visceral pleasure.</p>
