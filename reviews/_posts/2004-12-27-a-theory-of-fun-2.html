  <p>As a game developer, I am bound to be a bit more critical than average, but I couldn&#8217;t help but feel that Koster came up a bit short. He threw in a bit of psychology here, a few numbers there, and an anecdote or two, but the whole failed to gel into anything coherent. I don&#8217;t purport to have a textbook length treatise in my own head waiting to be put to paper, and I appreciate that the game development community must take many steps on the road to legitimacy, but neither can I deny having hoped for more.</p>
