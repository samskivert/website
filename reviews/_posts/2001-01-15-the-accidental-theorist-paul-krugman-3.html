  <p>I had no idea that economics could be so interesting. Krugman has a sharp wit and sensible ideas. I like the cut of his jib, especially his emphasis on the use of an understandable model as the basis for reasoning rather that the irrational speculation that seems to lure away many otherwise intelligent people (myself included). The use of a model is common to all sciences but in economics it is especially poignant because those speculations have to do with how the government should spend my money. If nothing else, I&#8217;ll feel less obliged to complain, or at least more informed in my complaints come next April 15th.</p>
