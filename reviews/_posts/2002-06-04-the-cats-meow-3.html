  <p>A fine film providing a speculative recreation of a weekend excursion on a yacht owned by Mr. W. R. Hearst. The cast was excellent and I liked the 1920s Hollywood feel. Not exactly a whodunit, not entirely comic, nor overly dramatic, simply well balanced, well executed and well enough described by this point, I hope.</p>
