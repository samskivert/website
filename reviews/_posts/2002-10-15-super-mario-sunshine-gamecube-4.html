  <p>A shining jewel in the rocky landscape of electronic games. There was no doubt in my mind that this game would be anything less than spectacular, and it has exceeded my expectations. The fluidity of the controls, attention to detail in the level design and general flow of game play are unsurpassed in my not insubstantial video gaming experience.</p>
