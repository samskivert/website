  <p>Kerouac writes freely, in a flowing style that seems to stream straight from his mind and onto the page. This combined with his tales of wandering the country being free and discovering beauty makes for a powerful story. I have to confess that Kerouac&#8217;s idea of the good life closely coincides with my own but I feel that he does a fine job of expressing the joy of that life in a way that&#8217;s accessible to others.</p>
