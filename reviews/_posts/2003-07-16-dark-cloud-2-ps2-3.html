  <p>Sigh. I hoped I could enjoy what is widely considered to be an innovative and excellently made RPG. None the less, two major factors prevent me from enjoying any RPG, it seems. Firstly, they seem to think that the longer the better. As if I want to devote 150 hours of my life to playing their game. Secondly, and this is much more important, if a game is going to affect any sort of narrative, I cannot cope with any less attention to detail than goes into a novel or a film. If I watch a movie and 90% of the dialog is stilted and poorly written, I&#8217;m sure as hell not going to enjoy it.</p>
