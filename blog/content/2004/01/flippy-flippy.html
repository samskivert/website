  <p>Nearly every store clerk from whom I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of receiving change in bills has done this really cool flippy thing where they swing the bills around with their pinky and snap them one by one in a very blatant counting process. It&#8217;s like Vegas!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have to find out if that&#8217;s part of the job training or if it&#8217;s just something one learns in the wily course of adolescence. Maybe I can even get someone to teach me if I show them how to spin a pen as part of a manual dexterity exchange program.</p>
