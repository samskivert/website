  <p>Indian antics! Not having seen many Bollywood films, this was an interesting peek into the world of upper middle class India. On the one hand, it wasn&#8217;t much more than a well constructed romantic comedy, but I found myself enchanted by the exotic combination of Indian and western culture that seemed to fit so easily together in a lifestyle that is likely enjoyed by a very small percentage of the country&#8217;s population.</p>
