<p>This is a pretty cool nuts and bolts paper about what the Haskell runtime team has been doing to improve performance of their parallel runtime. The description of the Haskell parallel runtime is perhaps the most fascinating part. Haskell is a non-traditional language: laziness and purity present interesting opportunities for parallelizing. The improvements they tried are not earth-shattering, but their investigations into whether and how they help are interesting.</p>
