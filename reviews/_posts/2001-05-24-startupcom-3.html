  <p>A telling documentary about the rise and fall of <a href="http://forum.fuckedcompany.com/fc/phparchives/search.php?search=govworks">govWorks.com</a>, your average third generation Internet startup. Having lived through the startup experience myself, I expected to be disappointed but instead found it to be an accurate characterization of the experience. Not to be missed if you were once looking down the business end of an Internet startup and an amusing modern tragedy even if you weren&#8217;t. Thank God we didn&#8217;t have to do stupid crap like their company cheer (at least, not while I was there).</p>
