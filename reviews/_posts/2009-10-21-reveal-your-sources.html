<p><a href="http://lemurware.blogspot.com/">Walter</a> expressed a desire for easy access to the papers covered here, so I have gone back and added a link to a PDF for all the papers I’ve reviewed and also a link to the ACM Portal site where possible. I’ll aim to do that going forward as well, though if there aren’t freely available versions I may only provide the ACM link and those of you with a membership can at least download them from there.</p>
