  <p>I&#8217;m a card-carrying non-fan of Lenny DiCaprio (I thank him for not detracting from the greatness of <cite>Romeo+Juliet</cite> but he didn&#8217;t add any value as far as I&#8217;m concerned). I don&#8217;t exactly get all hot and bothered about Mr. Hanks either. That said, by the end of this film, I found myself growing just a little fond of young Lenny&#8217;s winning smile and Tom&#8217;s humourless dedication. The story is a good one and the execution unfaltering.</p>
