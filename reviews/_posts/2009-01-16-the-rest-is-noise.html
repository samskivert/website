<p>Ross has such an encyclopedic knowledge of music that I can’t imagine what it’s like for her to listen to a new piece. It must be a constant parade of quotations and reminders. Fortunately for the reader, this gives her the ability to point out subtle connections and influences and combines with her incredible talent for describing music via written analogy to deliver an experience that is in some cases possibly better than listening to the music firsthand. I would love to someday read as thorough and well researched an account of the history of electronic music, though perhaps like most everything else in the late 20th century, that has exploded to such a size as to be impractical to accurately chronicle.</p>
