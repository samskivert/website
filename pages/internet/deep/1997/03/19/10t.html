<tt>There is a lisp convention to append the suffix 'p' to predicate
functions (functions that return true or false). They are then pronounced
name-pee. The particularly depraved reader might be inclined to pronounce
our handy evaluation function as evaluate sexp. In fact it was my
particularly depraved office mate who pointed it out to me.</tt>
