  <p>Having seen a stage production of this Oscar Wilde play, I was more than usually appreciative of the fantastic costumes and stunning on-location backdrops that are afforded when making a film. It is especially beneficial when poking fun at the extravagance of the English upper class. Production values aside, the actors did a fine job and Reese Witherspoon even managed not to seem out of place. Where Oliver Parker took liberties with the original, they perhaps didn&#8217;t live up to Wilde&#8217;s biting wit, but they were definitely in the same playful spirit.</p>
