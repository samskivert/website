<p>Desk plus projector plus video camera(s) plus some <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5772530828816089246">sweet 70s-style demo videos</a> equals the DigitalDesk. The idea here is to move the monitor and keyboard out of the way and try to make traditional pen and paper interactions on a desk more interactive. Interfaces are projected onto the desk, paper is scanned, edge-detected, OCRed, and the system tries to enable a sort of seamless melding of real ink and projected ink. Being that this was done in the 90s with slow computers, it’s not very usable (cue warnings from the Olsen paper), but it’s full of wacky and interesting ideas.</p>
