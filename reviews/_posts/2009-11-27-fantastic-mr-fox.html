<p>Fantastic indeed! Wes Anderson is definitely back on the upswing. He had already regained my trust with <cite>The Darjeeling Limited</cite>, but this is above and beyond the call of duty. Clooney was excellent, and the quirky animation and storytelling really worked well with Andersonâ€™s particular brand of kookiness.</p>
