<p>Someone told me the main character reminded them of me, so vanity demanded that I read this book. I applaud Steve Martin for being funny on screen and in letters, but his characterization of a software engineer is a bit ham fisted. I suppose he did the best he could to make a typically boring type of person seem a wee bit mysterious and desirable, at least compared to the complete slacker fuckup alternative. Anyhow, Iâ€™ll be sure to go glove shopping in another ten years.
