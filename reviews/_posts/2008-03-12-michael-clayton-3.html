<p>A mostly solid thriller that managed to indulge in cliche and unbelievability only occasionally. Incidentally, this was my first iTunes music rental and I am happy to report that the service is quite nice. It could do with a better selection, but I look forward to Apple ushering in an actually usable world of movies on demand after years technical possibility being expertly ignored or squandered by companies in a position to actually offer such a service.
