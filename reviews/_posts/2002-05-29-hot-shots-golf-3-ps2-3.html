  <p>A solid golf game with a variety of extra goodies to keep things interesting as you progress through the ranks. I was enamored enough of the game to win all of the tournaments, but when I discovered after beating all of the characters that one had to go back and do it all again, I wasn&#8217;t sufficiently inspired by the prospect of winning their special outfits to go to the trouble. Having played far too much <cite>Mario Golf</cite> in its time, I was surprised to discover how much more I liked the feel of <cite>Hot Shots</cite> when I happened to play a couple of rounds of my old favorite. Not that I don&#8217;t have high hopes for the upcoming <cite>Mario Golf</cite> on the Gamecube, but <cite>Hot Shots</cite> certainly did a fine job of keeping me entertained in these lean times.</p>
