  <p>I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and I really appreciated having some of the more fantastic scenes brought into sparkling visual life by the film. The three Alexis were all superbly cast and hearing that wacky English spoken was generally even funnier than reading it. I did come away with the feeling that had I not read the book, the movie would have been confusing and disconnected. So read the book first.</p>
