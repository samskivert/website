  <p>I can&#8217;t seem to play this game for more than 45 minutes at a stretch without wanting to fling the controller out the window and myself shortly thereafter. I can&#8217;t decide whether I&#8217;m being lazy or there are flaws in the game design, but I plan to give one more solid session where I push past the 45 minute barrier and see if a good three hours in the clutches of the beast settles my mind one way or the other. Thanks to the magic of the web, if you don&#8217;t read this before then, perhaps I can post a real review.</p>
