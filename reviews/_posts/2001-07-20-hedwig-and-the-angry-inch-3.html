  <p>More coherent than <cite>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</cite> (which may count against Hedwig in the minds of some), the music is great, the costumes are great, Hedwig is great. In terms of entertainment per unit time, this film is hard to beat. The caveat being that you better think that fabulous, cross-dressing, German rock stars are entertaining. If you thought that fabulous, cross-dressing, Transylvanian show-tune singers were great, I suppose that&#8217;s a safe bet.</p>
