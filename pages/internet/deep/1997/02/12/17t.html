<tt>An astute reader brought to my attention the following:</tt>

<p><font size="-1">You should be aware, however, that the fundamental
techniques described here (for example: the basic parse-tree-like
representation; the basic GA-like operators such as crossover defined as
the exchange of code sub-trees; etc.) predates Koza's work by several
years.<br>
<br>

For example, you may wish to look at the following paper (which appeared
at the first Genetic Algorithms conference held at Carnegie-Mellon in
1985):<br>
<br>

Cramer, Nichael Lynn: <cite>A Representation for the Adaptive Generation
of Simple Sequential Programs</cite>, Proceedings, International
Conference on Genetic Algorithms and their Applications, July 1985 [CMU],
pp183-187.<br>

This work is also described in David Goldberg's introductory book on GAs:<br>

Learning</cite> 1989.
