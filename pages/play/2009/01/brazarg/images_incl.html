<div class="title">Salvador, Brazil</div>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1723.JPG" />
<div>Our first sights in Salvador on the way into town from the airport. Very blocky.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1730.JPG" />
<div>We arrived at our very charming hotel and climbed a spiral staircase to the room.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1726.JPG" />
<div>Where we found a lovely view of the industrial port. If it hadn't been 90 degrees, I might have thought I was in Vladivostok.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1728.JPG" />
<div>But at least we had a nice pool in which to float while taking in the view.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1733.JPG" />
<div>The view from the bar was much nicer.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1735.JPG" />
<div>Somewhat delirious from jetlag and our first (incredibly strong) caipirinha, we wandered into the crowded streets.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1737.JPG" />
<div>Where we found strange works of art.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1739.JPG" />
<div>Gracefully aging churches.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1740.JPG" />
<div>Fading pastel colonial architecture.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1742.JPG" />
<div>A funicular!</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1746.JPG" />
<div>And we found out what Santa gets up to the other eleven months of the year.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1749.JPG" />
<div>The squares were densely populated with vendors intent that you not suffer for too long without a cocktail in your hand.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1750.JPG" />
<div>There were also many stray cats.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1755.JPG" />
<div>And inscrutable public art.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1762.JPG" />
<div>I much preferred the graffiti, which was stylish and sophisticated.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1763.JPG" />
<div>Here we have a scathing condemnation of the impact of gender roles among the bovine population of urban Brazil.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1765.JPG" />
<div>Here we have a polka dot building.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1780.JPG" />
<div>Here we have a reminder that Jesus died for our sins.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1772.JPG" />
<div>The central area of Salvador is split quite dramatically between an uptown and a downtown.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1768.JPG" />
<div>Eventually we made our way down the hill to a big market by the harbor.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1770.JPG" />
<div>Under which were spooky catacombs wherein slaves were once traded.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1783.JPG" />
<div>There was more excellent urban art down the hill.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1785.JPG" />
<div>On the day before we left, the entire town took the day off and had a giant party. Not on account of our departure, I presume.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="salvador/IMG_1790.JPG" />
<div>At the party we bumped into Barack Obama's secret younger brother. Unfortunately I didn't get a clearer shot of him. The secret service mind control rays were probably interfering with the camera.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="title">Morro de Sao Paolo, Brazil</div>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="morro/IMG_1812.JPG" />
<div>We then hopped onto this tiny plane and flew to the nearby island of Morro de Sao Paolo. Anita didn't like the idea of taking the two hour boat ride. By the end of the brief but bumpy plane trip, she was a much bigger fan of boat travel.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="morro/IMG_1797.JPG" />
<div>We had to make hotel reservations at the last minute. After five phone calls that exhausted my tiny Portuguese vocabulary, we ended up at the modest, but plucky Village Paraiso Tropical.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="morro/IMG_1795.JPG" />
<div>It wasn't posh, but the bar by the beach was quite nice.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="morro/IMG_1801.JPG" />
<div>Here we see the two main modes of transportation on the island: foot and tractor.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="morro/IMG_1800.JPG" />
<div>Some local charm: a fishing scow and butts.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="morro/IMG_1808.JPG" />
<div>As is my habit, I spent some of my time on the island upside down.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="title">Buenos Aires, Argentina</div>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="sanisidro/IMG_1824.JPG" />
<div>We then departed Brazil and headed to Buenos Aires. Our first stop was San Isidro, a sort of Argentinian Beverly Hills. We were staying in a colonial mansion that had been converted into a hotel.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="sanisidro/IMG_1816.JPG" />
<div>The room was tastefully decorated.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="sanisidro/IMG_1825.JPG" />
<div>Jesus was on the job nearby.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="sanisidro/IMG_1835.JPG" />
<div>Food in Brazil ranged from "not very good" to "gives you food poisoning", so we were ecstatic to be somewhere that we could order a salad. The salads at this charming little bistro were worth writing home about.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="sanisidro/IMG_1827.JPG" />
<div>We became very familiar with our local stop on the Tren de la Costa, because it turns out that San Isidro is a long way from anything interesting.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="sanisidro/IMG_1828.JPG" />
<div>The train, on the other hand, was quite interesting.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="sanisidro/IMG_1830.JPG" />
<div>Not to be outdone by Brazil, Argentina had a respectable supply of stray cats on display.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="palermo/IMG_1841.JPG" />
<div>Eventually we made our way to the Plaza de Mayo, wherein the tourists and government officials rubbed elbows.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="palermo/IMG_1846.JPG" />
<div>Said government officials all worked in the Pink House. Perhaps President Obama will take home some exterior decorating ideas from his next state visit to Argentina.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="palermo/IMG_1844.JPG" />
<div>Tucked into a nearby courtyard, Baby Jesus could be seen cavorting with every kind of ruminant to be found within five hundred miles of the fertile crescent.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="palermo/IMG_1856.JPG" />
<div>I eventually turned my attention to the local wildlife.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="palermo/IMG_1850.JPG" />
<div>The most popular species of which was canis lupus familiaris. There were more pet stores in Buenos Aires than there are Starbucks in Seattle.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="palermo/IMG_1859.JPG" />
<div>Touring around the city on foot, we saw thin towers...</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="palermo/IMG_1857.JPG" />
<div>...twisty trees...</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="palermo/IMG_1858.JPG" />
<div>...and more pink.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="palermo/IMG_1860.JPG" />
<div>We stopped in at the MALBA.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="palermo/IMG_1861.JPG" />
<div>Where the architecture was more interesting than the art.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="palermo/IMG_1863.JPG" />
<div>Departing the museum we had to cross this perilously wide street.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="palermo/IMG_1862.JPG" />
<div>On the other side we encountered a fleet of scooters ready and waiting to deliver icy cold relief to desperate Argentinians suffering in the heat.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1865.JPG" />
<div>We relocated to San Telmo (after a few days in Palermo wherein I seem to have taken no photos). From our balcony we were greeted by the full majesty of central Buenos Aires.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1879.JPG" />
<div>San Telmo had some lovely local markets.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1900.JPG" />
<div>And gnomes.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1875.JPG" />
<div>And more excellent graffiti.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1903.JPG" />
<div>Much of it was abstract.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1905.JPG" />
<div>Some with a cubist influence.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1901.JPG" />
<div>And some more minimalist.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1880.JPG" />
<div>We discovered in our wanderings that Buenos Aires has streets named for every country in the Americas. Eventually we found the one for the good old US of A. Not very glamorous.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1881.JPG" />
<div>My white linen pants had been dreaming of this trip ever since they joined my wardrobe.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1884.JPG" />
<div>San Telmo was a happening spot in the early 1900s, then everyone fled due to a cholera outbreak. In the intervening 100 years it's become a bit rougher around the edges, but hasn't lost its charm.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1891.JPG" />
<div>They do, however, seem to have forgotten that very important lesson about infectious disease.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1892.JPG" />
<div>In places, echoes linger of a more erudite age.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1894.JPG" />
<div>One day, we headed toward the Recoleta, where the rich relocated after the cholera. Along the way we encountered experimental new advertising techniques.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1908.JPG" />
<div>We also encountered very impressive residences.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1937.JPG" />
<div>Our destination that day was an enormous cemetery. Just before we arrived, we encountered an even more enormous tree.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1936.JPG" />
<div>The trunk was fenced off, perhaps to spare this ancient beast the indignity of having teenagers carve their fleeting passions into its roots.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1910.JPG" />
<div>As we wandered in search of dead people, I eventually spied this pious image and suspected we were on the right track.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1911.JPG" />
<div>It's hard to convey the size of this cemetery. There were dozens of little alleys branching every-which way. It was a sprawling metropolis of death.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1916.JPG" />
<div>Here we catch Anita gently rapping, rapping at the chamber door.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1917.JPG" />
<div>I didn't frame this shot intentionally. Clearly it's a sign from the heavens.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1921.JPG" />
<div>This was a not so successful attempt to have my ghostly visage appear to descend the stairs into the tomb below.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1924.JPG" />
<div>Creepy spider webs were in plentiful supply. I thought they made that up in vampire movies, but spiders really do love crypts.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1926.JPG" />
<div>This filing cabinet for corpses had lost a door. I waited expectantly for the lid to slide slowly off the coffin and a withered hand to reach out, but no such luck.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1930.JPG" />
<div>Many tombs had angels and other heavenly figures gracing their exteriors.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1929.JPG" />
<div>And the Burton family has a plot here in Buenos Aires it seems.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1896.JPG" />
<div>During the entire trip, the weather forecast had been incorrectly predicting rain. Just before we left, they finally got it right.</div>
</div><br/>
<div class="box">
<img width="100%" src="santelmo/IMG_1897.JPG" />
<div>When the rain finally stopped, we were treated to this cheerful sight, with which I'll end this photo tour. So long Argentina and thanks for all the sweets.</div>
</div><br/>
