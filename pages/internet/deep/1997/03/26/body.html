The yellowy color in the background of this frame is specified in the HTML
as #FFFF99. This, of course, is the popular RGB color-encoding scheme,
easily understood by computer and <a href="01.html" target="define"><b>HTML freaks the world over</b></a><sup><font size="-1">1</font></sup>. In the above representation, each color component is expressed as a
two-digit hexidecimal number. A more readable representation might be
(255, 255, 153), which means the red value is 255 (all the way on),
blue is 255, and green is 153. All black would be (0, 0, 0), and pure red
would be (255, 0, 0). 

<P>RGB is the most obvious way to represent color on a
computer. Why? Because that's how a monitor works.

Dear Geekman, 
<br><br>
When I sneeze on my monitor, I see all these cool colors on an otherwise
white screen, why?

<P>Dear Jeff,

<P>   Funny, after I sneeze I see either little stars or complete blackness
for a few seconds! Ha, ha, ha! 

<P>

You may be surprised to learn that on a normal CRT monitor, a pixel is
actually made up of three smaller dots of different colors.  These
dots are bits of phosphor paint and are
either red, blue or green. When the electron ray inside the monitor hits
them, they light up for a brief time, forming the pixel's color. You can
make any color you want by mixing red, blue, and green in the right
combinations. 

<P>Normally, these dots are so close together that you see them as one color.
But when you sneeze on your monitor, the droplets act like tiny
magnifying glasses, bending the light and making the red, green, and blue
dots visible. You might actually see the separate components of each pixel.
Another thing you can
try is to put your face REALLY close to the monitor and look at a
white line. If your monitor is poorly adjusted, it sometimes will have a
small red shadow to the lower right, and a fainter blue shadow to the
upper left. If you stare long enough, YOU WILL GO BLIND! Ha, ha, just
another joke, kids; actually you'll only need really thick glasses. 

<P>Now, because each color is in a certain position, I can make a
picture -- composed entirely of red, blue and green -- that appears white.

On the left is a "white line", on the right is a zoom-in on this line.
If you don't trust me you can download that image and zoom for yourself.
This is just a trick exploiting the positions of the smaller components
of a pixel.

<P>So next time you sneeze on the monitor, take a few moments to examine
the beauty that your mucus has exposed.

<P>RGB is common on computers because the software uses it to tell the
hardware how to paint a color. The electron gun needs to know
how brightly to light up each dot within a pixel.
This brightness is represented in 8 bits, which gives 256 
brightness values for each color, for a total palette of exactly
16,777,216 colors.<P> 

So RGB was chosen because it directly corresponds to the medium. In other
mediums, different color-encoding schemes have been used. For example, in
paper printing, something known as CMYK is used. The C stands for cyan, the M
for magenta, and the Y for yellow. K is for black; I suppose because they
thought B would look like Blue. CMYK is a subtractive color system,
because you start out with white, the color of the paper. If you want to
print green, you <a href="02.html" target="define"><b>mix cyan and yellow</b></a><sup><font size="-1">2</font></sup>.

<P>Years of using RGB has made it second-nature to me, but many people find it
cumbersome. An alternate color encoding, HSV, is based on the more readily
understood concepts of
tint, shade and tone. Three-dimensionally, think of HSV as a
cone. H, or hue, is a number between 0 and 360 -- the angle around
the vertical axis. Value, V, is a number between 0 and 1 -- the
distance from tip to base of the cone. S is shade -- the distance
from the center line. Because of the conic shape, brightness values near 0
have less shade information.<P>

<param name="bgcolor" value="ffff99">
</applet>
<P>(Note- if you are viewing this in a low-color environment, the HSV
circle might look funky, and you won't get the most out of this)

<P>Notice that V is only as strong as the strongest component of RGB. 

<P>While RGB is the best format for encoding graphics for
computers, it is not the most efficient. Many bits are wasted
in the lower brightness levels. The human eye has a tough time
distinguishing (0, 0, 22) from (0, 0, 21) or any of the other
low-brightness colors, though they are given equal importance to bright red
under
RGB. An encoding system very similar to RGB is YIQ, which is used on your
television set. YIQ is simply RGB re-encoded for transmission efficiency
and compatibility with black-and-white television signals. The
way it works is fairly simple: Since your eye is most sensitive to
brightness, that gets the most bits of encoding. Only the brightness, Y, is
picked up by black-and-white televisions. I and Q get
significantly fewer bits, and are used only in color televisions. 

<P>Computer file formats also require efficient encoding. If this can
save a few bits for each pixel, it
can significantly reduce the overall size of the image. There are quite
a few ways to do this, and JPEG files use one of them: YCbCr. This scheme
is closely related to YIQ, with <a href="03.html" target="define"><b>the Cb and Cr rotated about the Y axis</b></a><sup><font size="-1">3</font></sup>.

<P>The JPEG format (<a href="04.html" target="define"><b>JFIF</b></a><sup><font size="-1">4</font></sup>) can save significant space because typical
digitized photographs have areas of similar brightness. The file
format specifies a brightness for a 64-pixel area
with one value, then uses a few bits to adjust the luminance up or
down from this value for each pixel. This bit of trickery normally is
great, but it fails to encode simply colored items like this single line.

On the left is a simple red line, saved as a gif. On the right, the same
image has been re-saved as a jpg.
</td></tr></table></center>
<P><P>
As you 
can see, JPEG makes some assumptions about what is important and what
isn't, and it assigns bits accordingly. The
extra information gets thrown away, and there is no way to get it back
when the image is decompressed. Once you know what is assumed, it is easy
to construct a lot of examples like this. 
<P><P>
 
<P>So next time you use color in a computer program, remember: RGB isn't the
only kid on the block, just the first one. There are as many ways to
encode color as there are colors themselves. If you would like more
