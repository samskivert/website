<p>After almost two years of taking enthusiastic liberties with the themes of the Wild West, we’ve finally shipped <a href="http://www.banghowdy.com/">Bang! Howdy</a>. Since it’s an online game this doesn’t mean something wonderful like we’re done working on it,  just that we have to be more careful when we ship new features as a bunch of people will be annoyed if we break anything. But it is nice to be reminded of why it is that we toil long and hard when we see people playing and enjoying the game.
