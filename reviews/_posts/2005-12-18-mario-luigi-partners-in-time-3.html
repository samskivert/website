  <p>I devoured it like a bowl of chocolate ice cream. Mmm&#8230; ice cream. How a translation of a Japanese product can consistently be the funniest game around does boggle the mind. Perhaps in-jokes about the Mario franchise span cultures, or the translators were chemically inspired. The platform-style RPG battles remain appealing. The bosses unfailingly succumbed to my pouncing blows mere moments after I wondered, &#8220;When in the hell is this battle going to end?&#8221; A neat, tidy package of fun.</p>
