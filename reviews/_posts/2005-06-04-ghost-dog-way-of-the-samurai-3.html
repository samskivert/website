  <p>I dug the mood of the film, but there were times when the samurai schtick was pushed a bit too far. I admire a filmmaker with the balls to make a film with a strong moral statement but I&#8217;d prefer one with more substance. And the scene with the bear hunters should have been left on the cutting room floor.</p>
