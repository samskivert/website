<h3>What is it?</h3>

<p> The Banana User Interface toolkit is built atop the
<a href="http://www.jmonkeyengine.com">jMonkeyEngine</a> (JME), a 3D
engine for Java that is currently built on top of
<a href="http://www.lwjgl.org">LWJGL</a>. BUI aims to provide an
interface toolkit with the following characteristics:

<ul>
<li> A component hierarchy and event dispatch model familiar to users
     of Swing and the AWT
<li> An easily customizable look and feel to allow game developers the
     necessary flexibility to create an interface consistent with
     their game's art style
<li> As full-featured as possible a user experience, providing
     standard UI functionality such as focus, cut and paste, keyboard
     navigation and control and so forth (we have a long way to go on
     this front)
<li> An open source license that allows the toolkit to be used and
     extended at no cost by developers working on personal and
     commercial projects
</ul>

<p> BUI is presently in the very early stages, but is being rapidly
expanded in conjunction with a commercial game. As functionality is
needed within the game, support will be added to the toolkit.  See the
Contribution setion below if you would like to help with the project.

<p> Here's a quick screen shot:

<h3>Downloading</h3>

The BUI source code is available for download. The latest version of
the code is available from the Subversion repository and some
inevitably out of date version is available as a zip archive.

<p> BUI is released under the
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/lgpl.html">LGPL</a>. The most
recent version of the library should always be available at
<a href="http://samskivert.com/code/jme-bui/">
http://samskivert.com/code/jme-bui</a>.

<h3>Building</h3>

Building BUI requires <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">ant</a> and an
up-to-date build of JME. Place the JME and LWJGL jar files in the
<code>lib/</code> directory of the BUI source tree and run <code>ant
dist</code> to build the library.

<h3>Contribution</h3>

<p> Contributions are welcome. Discussion generally takes place in the
<a href="http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/jmeforum/index.php?board=11.0">GUI
forum</a> of the JME website. Patches and enhancements can be
discussed there and sent to
<a href="mailto:mdb@samskivert.com">mdb@samskivert.com</a> for
inclusion in the library.
