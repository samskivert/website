  <p>While making non-narcissistic use of the <a href="http://www.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a>, I couldn&#8217;t resist finding out what it had to say about <a href="http://www.go2net.com/">go2net</a>, an Internet company for which I must admittedly take a certain responsibility. They go as far back as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19961229020840/http://www.go2net.com/">December 1996</a>, the proverbial damned long time ago.</p>
<p>How we managed to go from jabbering about a wacky idea in a brew pub in San Diego to fully operational Internet site with five major products in little more than five months still boggles my mind &mdash; though it does lend credence to my bitching about working <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970615145459/www.go2net.com/internet/404/archive/1996/11_25.html">&#8220;18 hours a day, 7 days a week&#8221;</a>.</p>
