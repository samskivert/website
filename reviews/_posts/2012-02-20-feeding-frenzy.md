This is the sort of research that a good systems engineer would love to do, but
almost never has time, due to the ever-present need to ship. When some time can
be scraped together to do it, it's rarely as thorough and even more rarely as
well documented. The results are embarassingly useful, given the propensity of
every Web 2.0 startup on the block to have posting, following and feeds in some
form or other. Score one for applied research.
