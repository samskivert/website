  <p>I love Hesse&#8217;s story, but the film would have been better it were made by people who knew the first thing about cinematography and acting. It played like a home movie. To be fair, it wasn&#8217;t wholly without redeeming value; the scenery was beautiful and parts of the film were pretty funny, though not intended to be so.</p>
