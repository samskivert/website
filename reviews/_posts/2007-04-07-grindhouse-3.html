<p>Rodriguez’s film was a fine display of hot zombie on zombie action with no shortage of tongue in cheek. The trailers in between were outright hilarious. Tarantino’s film was just stressful. Fortunately it veered so far into the realm of the ridiculous that the stress started to evaporate, but we could have used some comic relief or something.
