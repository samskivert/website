  <p>If it weren&#8217;t for the torturously slow first half of this film, it might be recommendable. I would have more enjoyed a straightforward narrative where I bore witness to the non-reordeded sequence of events that took our protagonist from healthy youth into graphomanaical adulthood. Instead, I was subjected to the endless tedium of life in confinement and much too much later, given the gratification of explanation in a series of flashbacks that, gut wrenching as they were, did little to salvage the overall movie-going experience.</p>
