  <p>Aside from Maribel Verd&#xFA;, <cite>Y tu mam&#xE1; tambi&#xE9;n</cite> was uninspiring. The scenery is much more fascinating than the characters, though I appreciated the scenes of rural Mexico. Ultimately, the film is a bit too trite and tries a bit too hard to be insightful. A Mexican <cite>Thelma and Louise</cite> it is not.</p>
