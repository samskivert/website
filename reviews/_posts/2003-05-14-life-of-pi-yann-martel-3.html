  <p>An anything but ordinary tale of a boy and his tiger as they float across the Pacific. Martel tells an engrossing story that takes a few dozen pages to get started, but once it does you may find yourself up until dawn as I was, unable to stop reading. I also appreciated his exposition on the beauty underlying religious faith even as one that seeks that beauty by other means.</p>
