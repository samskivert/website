Will we ever achieve a body of digital architectural knowledge that rivals our
physical architectural knowledge?

Most websites feel like shopping (or strip) malls. Even "nice" websites feel
like upscale shopping malls, rather than like the Louvre or the Parthenon.

Does it even make sense to talk about graphic archtecture?

Enumerate aspects of archtecture (affordances, flow of people through
structure, (artificial and natural) lighting (through course of day),
mechanical constraints (plumbing, electrical), etc.), draw parallels to
graphic/website design.

Should a forum provide the same architectural cues as the Roman Forum?
