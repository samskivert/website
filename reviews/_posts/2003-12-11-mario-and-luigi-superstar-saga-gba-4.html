  <p>Hallelujah! Someone has finally made an RPG that I have enjoyed. To be honest, this was at least one-third old-school Mario Brothers platformer, but it was definitely an RPG. They said &#8220;Level up!&#8221; a good fifty or a hundred times. This game is like the Bugs Bunny cartoons of old, it appears to be for kids but actually demonstrates a sophisticated and clever sense of humor. In many ways this game was way funnier than any episode of Bugs Bunny I&#8217;ve ever seen. Between this and Advance Wars, I&#8217;m having more fun on my GBA lately than I&#8217;ve had on any platform ever.</p>
