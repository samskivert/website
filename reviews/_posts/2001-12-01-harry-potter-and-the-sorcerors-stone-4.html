  <p>An utterly delightful movie. Finally, lovers of fantasy have been given the gift of an engaging, intelligent, visually stunning rendition of the world of wizards and witches. On top of all that, the public at large has a fresh treatment of the classic themes which picks up the ball that George Lucas has so firmly dropped. Between <cite>Harry Potter</cite> and <cite>The Fellowship of the Ring</cite>, the years of abuse and neglect that Hollywood has heaped upon my AD&#038;D playing inner-child may finally be atoned.</p>
