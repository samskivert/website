  <p>Mostly I saw this film because I wanted to see Johnny Depp dressed in drag and parading himself among the denizens of a Cuban prison. However, it turned out to be quite good. I&#8217;ve never really felt much of a response to poetry, but Reynaldo Arenas has a way with words that an illiterate such as myself can appreciate.</p>
