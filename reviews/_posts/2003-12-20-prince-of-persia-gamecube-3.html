  <p>This was an excellently done game. In fact, it was a great deal like <cite>Ico</cite> but with a bit more narrative and a bit more action which kept me involved with the game. I lament that with all the effort put into making the game look and feel cinematic, they made do with a mediocre plot and mediocre dialogue. The plot I can forgive &#8212; I don&#8217;t mind the occasional formulaic narrative &#8212; but the interaction between the two main characters was like a bad sitcom. Couldn&#8217;t they find someone to write better jokes? I suppose I should be happy that I can even talk about the &#8220;interaction between the two main characters.&#8221; Many games that purport to have narrative don&#8217;t manage to convey even the faintest idea that the characters could actually be real people with feelings and desires and a propensity to &#8220;interact&#8221; when they find themselves together in trying circumstances.</p>
