  <p>A long, aimless film that opens one can of worms after another. I got the feeling that the intent was to explore some interesting moral issues relating to artificial intelligence (it was hard not to get that feeling thanks to the standard practice of speaking the subtext loudly and clearly as dialogue in one contrived scene after another). Unfortunately, neither Spielberg nor Kubrick could sort out quite how to explore those issues and I spent the whole time waiting for anything to happen that made sense. The special effects are groovy; the actors do a fine job; it is simply the writing and direction that leave me wondering whether this film accomplishes anything other than separating millions of people from the cost of a movie ticket.</p>
