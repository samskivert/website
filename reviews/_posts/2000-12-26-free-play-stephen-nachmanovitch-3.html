  <p>This period of my life is one of convergence. Not so much questions being answered as pieces falling into place and <i>Free Play</i> helped more pieces to fall into place. It&#8217;s a well executed treatise on creativity; creativity in many contexts and from many angles. It is both an inspiration to create and a helpful reminder of how to facilitate the process. The book is not lengthy, but not concise either. It comes recommended if you feel that a nudge toward creativity would do you good.</p>
