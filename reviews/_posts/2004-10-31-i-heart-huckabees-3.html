  <p>A frantic film that in its very incoherence captured the confusion and directionlessness that infect us in youth but rarely mature into such kooky antics. If one avoids feeling the need to look for a message amidst the mayhem, an entertaining experience is there to be had. As well, the vaguely philosophical nature of the film may even provide inspiration to think about your own philosophies of life, which are hopefully not as much a jibbering mess as those in the film.</p>
