  <p>I happened to notice there were comments on some of my posts. Rather surprised that anyone I knew would bother to spend words on this solipsistic enterprise, I curiously investigated. I was right in a totally unexpected way. Spammers are apparently now posting to blogs with semantically ambiguous content, presumably in hopes that people will click on the link provided to the &#8220;poster&#8217;s&#8221; home page. They leave no stone unturned.</p>
