  <p>A laugh-out-loud book from another of those funny Brits. Given that the degree to which a book like this is funny probably scales linearly with the degree to which I identify with the protagonist, I should probably be disturbed by how much I was laughing. Perhaps I&#8217;ll console myself with the thought that others laughed harder.</p>
