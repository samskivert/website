  <p>Mmm.. Mario Golf. I liked this every bit as much as Mario Golf for the N64, in spite of all the whining done by every game reviewer under the sun. The special courses are great (peskily difficult in some cases) and the changes to the controls became totally natural after some practice. I only wish it had network support (and the built-in support for betting) so that we could have reinstated our Korman-ATM golf tournaments.</p>
