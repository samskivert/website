<p>Describes a nice technique for tracking enough information at each call site to reconstruct the stack at said call site with high probability after the fact. They implemented the technique in the <a href="http://jikesrvm.org/">Jikes RVM</a> and got reasonably good reconstruction with overheads in the range of 10-20%. They augmented a race detector and null pointer origin tracker, and I can imagine various other clients for which it would be great to report a full call stack rather than just a single program point.</p>
