  <p><img style="margin-left: 5px" src="http://www-0.expo2005.or.jp/en/g/top_blue.jpg" align="right"> There is a huge billboard in Shibuya with a digital display counting down to this inscrutable EXPO thing, the nature of which remained a mystery to me <a href="http://www-0.expo2005.or.jp/en/index.html">until now.</a></p>
<p>Leave it to Japan to blow untold quantities of cash on something so touchy feely as giving everyone a &#8220;global perspective&#8221; to work toward solving the environmental problems that have reared their ugly heads during the 20th century. Indeed, more likely the insatiable construction industry in Japan ran out of places to erect new buildings in Tokyo and needed something to satisfy their craving for government funds.</p>
<p>None the less, a <a href="http://www-0.expo2005.or.jp/en/venue/experience05.html">full-scale replica</a> of the house from <cite>My Neighbor Totoro</cite> is worth a few billion yen no questions asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us do this for all life and the future of our planet!&#8221;</p>
