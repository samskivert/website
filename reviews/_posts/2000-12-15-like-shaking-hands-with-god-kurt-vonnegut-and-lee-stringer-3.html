  <p>As the title claims, it&#8217;s a conversation about writing between these two writers. Vonnegut I&#8217;ve read and have a sympathy and apreciation for his take on life. Stringer I developed an instant respect for after reading his response to the first question posed in the conversation. I&#8217;ll be reading his work in the near future. The book is a worthwhile read for anyone pursuing or interested in writing, more so because it only takes an hour to read.</p>
