  <p>My next foray into Twain&#8217;s bibliography is one of his earliest published books. I can happily report that his razor sharp wit was not something he developed later in his career. I thoroughly enjoyed the relentless piss-taking that he leveled at just about everything considered sacred and beautiful from Northern France to Northern Egypt. He is every bit a judgemental, beligerent old coot, and I love it.</p>
