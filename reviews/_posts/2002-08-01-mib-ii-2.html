  <p>I actually knew better than to see this film, but I really wanted to see at least one movie while I was in Tokyo and this was the best of the miniscule selection of English language films playing thereabouts. As you might expect, the jokes were a bit tired and the special effects nicely polished; the romance element was overplayed and the film had Hollywood written all over it.</p>
