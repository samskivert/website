<tt>An encoding trie ('trie' comes from 'information re_trie_val') is a binary
tree representing bit encodings for the characters in the alphabet.  We treat
a 0 as traversing the left edge leaving a node, and a 1 as traversing the
right edge.
<br><br>In Figure 1, for instance, we encode E as the bit sequence 10,
as we traverse right once and then left once from the root node.</tt>
