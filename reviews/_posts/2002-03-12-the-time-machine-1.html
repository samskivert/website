  <p>I think this film gives <cite>Planet of the Apes</cite> some serious competition for the worst movie I&#8217;ve ever seen. Guy Pierce was horribly cast as the eccentric scientist and the pacing and plot boggled the mind. I wish I had a time machine of my own so that I could use it to tell my past self not to go see this movie.</p>
