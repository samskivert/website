<p>An interesting and readable collection of essays on astrophysics. The author isnâ€™t afraid to expose his sense of humor, which livens up potentially dry material at the cost of the occasional groaner. He ranges somewhat randomly through astronomy, physics, and math, with a fair bit of history thrown in for color and background. It was a relaxingly easy read, especially in contrast to the first few hundred pages of <cite>The Road to Reality</cite> that I soldiered through on my winter break.</p>
