image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/19/img_1061.jpg Micah admires the view.

image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/19/img_1063.jpg The barking sands!
image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/19/img_1064.jpg The interwebs at sunset.
image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/20/img_1065.jpg Kauai is jungly. 
image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/20/img_1066.jpg We set out on a hike on the north shore. Behold, the north shore.

image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/20/img_1068.jpg I was exhibiting fine fashion sense, as usual.
image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/20/img_1069.jpg Don't become another statistic.
image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/20/img_1070.jpg Local wildlife.
image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/20/img_1071.jpg These rocks were pleasingly round.

image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/20/img_1074.jpg Damned primates, always messing up the place.
image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/20/img_1075.jpg Micah is crazy enough to jump into the cold as hell pond below the waterfall.
image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/20/img_1076.jpg The water, she falls.

image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/20/img_1079.jpg Let's get another angle on that Bob.
image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/20/img_1080.jpg A lesser waterfall, but still quite nice.
image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/20/img_1081.jpg Lush.
image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/20/img_1082.jpg I rage against the bamboo.
image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/20/img_1084.jpg Nice waves. Too bad I don't know how to surf.
image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/20/img_1085.jpg It's probably for the best. I'd just end up lying injured on the rocks.
image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/20/img_1086.jpg This guy on the other hand, knew his way around a surf board.
image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/20/img_1087.jpg Kowabunga.

image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/20/img_1089.jpg  Back to the north shore. Still fabulous. And that's all folks.
