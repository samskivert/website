  <p>Somehow the bleak inhumanity of it all resonated more deeply with me during my angst-ridden teen years. Now I&#8217;m of the opinion that if you haven&#8217;t found a reason to live by 25 then perhaps you should be trying a little harder. None the less, the incessant rationalizing seems to give way to some good clean action by about page 250 and things stay interesting from there through to the finish. </p>
