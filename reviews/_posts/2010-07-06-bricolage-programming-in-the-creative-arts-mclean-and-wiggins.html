<p>This is a surprisingly postmodern paper (for the field of computer science anyhow), and it is accordingly pretty content free. However, they include  data from <a href="http://www.ppig.org/papers/18th-blackwell.pdf">research</a> on metaphors used by programmers to talk about programs, which is interesting. A few examples: “components own and trade data,” “execution is a journey in some landscape,” and “data is a substance that flows and is stored.”</p>
