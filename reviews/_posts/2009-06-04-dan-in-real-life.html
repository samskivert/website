<p>I can’t dissociate Steve Carell from his role as Michael Scott in <cite>The Office</cite>. That didn’t totally ruin the movie for me, but it did make me expect to cringe any time something even remotely socially awkward was about to take place. He’s probably doomed to nothing but voice overs for animation as far as I’m concerned.</p>
