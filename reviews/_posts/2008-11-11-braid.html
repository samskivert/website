<p>Two thumbs up. Not only is the novel rewinding gameplay mechanic fun, excellently executed and thoroughly explored, but the ambiance and story are serene  and literate, a refreshing change from the grunting violence or (sorry Mario) vapid childishness that tends to make up the bulk of our industry’s creative output. I’d be proud to have made this game.</p>
