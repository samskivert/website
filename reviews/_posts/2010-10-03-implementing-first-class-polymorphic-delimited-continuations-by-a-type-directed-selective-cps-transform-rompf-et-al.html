title: "Implementing First-Class Polymorphic Delimited Continuations by a Type-Directed Selective CPS-Transform – Rompf, et al."
category: papers
---

<p>I think it’s been six months since I read this paper, but I kept thinking that I had already written a note about it in my blog. I must have shifted that computation into a delimited continuation and then forgotten to call the continuation, so it never got executed. Ah, computer science humor.</p>
<p>Continuations (delimited or otherwise) can quickly make code incomprehensible, as the examples in this paper so nicely demonstrate. However, used in a disciplined manner, they can do some very nice things, including <a href="http://github.com/sanity/Swarm">distributed computing</a>, <a href="http://lamp.epfl.ch/~imaier/">improved UI APIs</a> and <a href="http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/148043">reactive programming</a>.</p>
