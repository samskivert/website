<p>I like Linklater’s rambling dialogue, so I overcame my worry that this was just a romantic comedy and  gave it a run up the flagpole. It wasn’t as bad as a romantic comedy, which was a relief, but it wasn’t especially gripping. I think I failed to identify with the main characters. Maybe I’m getting old.
