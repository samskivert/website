  <p>A pleasant romp of a story. Having seen the movie before, I couldn&#8217;t help but imagine Audrey Hepburn&#8217;s perkiness as I read. However, far from detracting from the experience, it rather inclined me to think that the casting director for the film was brilliant. In any case, I liked it much more than <cite>In Cold Blood</cite>.</p>
