  <p>Let it be known that Tim Schafer and his colleagues at Double Fine are funny people. In addition to serving up a veritable banquet of humor, they took excellent advantage of the liberties afforded by making a game about the crazy worlds inside peoples&#8217; heads. This resulted in some very memorable and clever level designs. The platforming itself was pretty good, but didn&#8217;t rub me quite as rightly as, say, Sly Cooper, which is a much fairer comparison than pulling out the big yardstick they call Mario. I look forward to more juicy fruit from their creative tree.</p>
