  <p>I surived another GDC. Daniel and I gave a presentation on Puzzle Pirates, the <a href="/work/2005/gdc/pp_lessons_learned.ppt">slides for which</a> are available for perusal. There are lots of pretty pictures and graphs in there, but the words alas disappeared into the ether after we spoke them. The <a href="http://crystaltips.typepad.com/wonderland/2005/03/burn_the_house_.html">Burning Down the House</a> talk was inspiring, but it didn&#8217;t usurp my all-time favorite GDC talk, Professor Moriarty&#8217;s <a href="http://ludix.com/moriarty/psalm46.html">Secret of Psalm 46</a>, given back in 2001.</p>
