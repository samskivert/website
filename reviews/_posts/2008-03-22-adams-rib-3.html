<p>Nothing like some jovial legal humor from 1949. To its credit, I don’t recall ever seeing a film from that period that so directly tackled women’s rights. My intuition is that this quote captured the general consensus of the time:</p>
<p>Hepburn: Do you believe that women should be treated equally in matters of the law?<br>
Potential Juror: I should say not!
