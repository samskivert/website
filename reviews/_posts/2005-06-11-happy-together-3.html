  <p>Wong Kar Wai is still amazing. He had no trouble finding the same gritty, sweaty humanity in Buenos Aires that worked so well in his Hong Kong films. I can only hope that he lives a long time and continues to indulge his skill for capturing the tragedy and beauty of the human experience on film.</p>
