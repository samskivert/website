<tt>I was recently pointed in the direction of a project called
<a href="http://www.technosphere.org.uk/" target="_blank">Technosphere II</A> which could be quickly
described as a foray into the collaborative investigation of the evolution
of interacting and competing creatures. This would hardly do it justice
and I would recommend that you rush off and check it out immediately
except that it's offline for another week or so. However, I'd highly
recommend bookmarking the site and heading back in a week to check it
out. It is extremely cool.</tt>
