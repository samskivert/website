  <p>For some reason, I find that just about anything is better with the careful addition of monkeys; perhaps it&#8217;s our shared lineage, or perhaps it&#8217;s a reflection of all the fun I had playing the <cite>Monkey Island</cite> series. Regardless, I&#8217;m sure <cite>Super Monkey Ball</cite> would be just as fun even if the marbles one rolls around the increasingly challenging courses weren&#8217;t occupied by screeching little monkeys. The levels proceed from simple, through good clean fun, and on up to &#8220;Sweet Jesus! I&#8217;m going to need 40 grams of methamphetamine and seventy two sleepless hours to get through this one.&#8221; The multiplayer options aren&#8217;t exactly inspired, but they&#8217;ve satisfied the need for hot four player action in these trying months before Kart is to be released for the GameCube. I am a bit disturbed by the thought of the thousands of monkey corpses that I&#8217;ve littered over the ground below the elevated courses.</p>
