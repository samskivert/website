  <p>CBFD is a well executed game, soup to nuts. Even if it wasn&#8217;t chock full of scatological humor, brilliant movie parodies and tongue in cheek sexual innuendo, it would be a great platformer and a darned good adventure game. All things considered, it&#8217;s one of the best video games I&#8217;ve played since Monkey Island III. (Bear in mind that I&#8217;m a fan of platformers and adventure games, so you won&#8217;t find me raving about the latest FPS or RTS offerings.) It is shorter than your average game, but in these bountiful times, I count that as a blessing.</p>
