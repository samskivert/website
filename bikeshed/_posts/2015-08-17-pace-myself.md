Just a quick note this week to mention that I'm moving to a bi-weekly schedule. I've lately been
attending a bi-weekly game prototype/design meetup, and it's working nicely for me to be super
excited about video games one weekend, and programming languages the next. I have to balance the
time I spend on my various enthusiasms.

See you next week!
