  <p>What a depressing book. I suppose I can&#8217;t fault the author for wanting to share her tale of growing up in a vicious loveless family and it&#8217;s a small miracle that she managed to find any love within herself at all after suckling from the dry, thorny teat up to and beyond her parents&#8217; death. However, this is not my preferred brand of schadefreude. Pass the happiness and triumph please.</p>
