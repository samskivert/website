  <p>A fine piratical film which I&#8217;d seen before but held a repeat viewing so as to share the fun with my pirate mateys. Some of the songs are a bit much and some of the humor more than a bit strained, but on the whole it&#8217;s a fine muppet film; Tim Curry is brilliant and who can resist the cameo by the Swedish Chef. Bork bork bork!</p>
