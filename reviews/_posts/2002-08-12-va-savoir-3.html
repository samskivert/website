  <p>This is the sort of movie that is inevitably described as charming and I can&#8217;t really disagree with that assessment. It&#8217;s not exactly a great movie and it doesn&#8217;t seem to have anything particular to say. Yet, I couldn&#8217;t help but enjoy it. Must be those kooky French.</p>
