<p><a href="/internet/deep/1997/05/21/body.html">Last week</a>, I
described a distributed-object system and implemented a simple chat
applet. If you recall, I promised something a little more exciting than a
chat applet to demonstrate the true usefulness of the distributed-object
system. This week is upon us, and I present to you something <a
href="01.html" target="define"><b>very exciting
indeed</b></a><sup>1</sup>.

I have written, for your amusement, a <a href="02.html"
target="define"><b>multiplayer networked game</b></a><sup>2</sup>. True to
my claims, all player interaction takes place through the use of
distributed objects. In fact, with a few small additions, last week's
distributed-object system became this week's <a href="03.html"
target="define"><b>foundation for networked
games</b></a><sup>3</sup>. Without further ado, we'll dive right into how
it works.

<p><b>The management</b><br>

Most of the server functionality is encapsulated into manager
classes. Last week, I described the <a href="04.html"
target="define"><b>function of the
<code>DObjectManager</code></b></a><sup>4</sup>.  Another manager was
lurking around that I didn't mention. That was the <a target="code"
href="dserver/ClientManager.java"><code>ClientManager</code></a>. This
manager sits around listening for client connections and keeps track of
clients while they're connected to the server. It tracks them in a
distributed object, which is how the chat applet manages to display a list
of all the other people connected to the server. This week, a new manager
has been introduced to the staff, that being the <a target="code"
href="dserver/GameManager.java"><code>GameManager</code></a>.

<p>The game manager keeps track of all the games in two objects. One
contains all the games that are waiting for players, and the other tracks
games in progress. Each game has its own distributed object that contains
at least a list of the players and couple of other simple
attributes. Subscribed to each game-distributed object is a <a
href="05.html" target="define"><b><code>Game</code>
object</b></a><sup>5</sup>. The <a target="code"
href="dserver/Game.java"><code>Game</code></a> object performs basic state
management for a game from the server side (waiting until the correct
number of

</table>

people have joined the game, making the game-distributed object go away if
all the players leave the game). A real game will not use the default
<code>Game</code> object but instead will derive from <code>Game</code> to
implement state-management functionality specific to that game. In our
case, we have the <code>WordGameGame</code> class, which I'll get to in a
moment.

<p>One last thing to note about the server architecture is that it needn't
be re-compiled or even restarted to add a game to its repertoire. Through
the <a href="06.html" target="define"><b>magic of dynamic
class-loading</b></a><sup>6</sup>, we can create a new client and a new
server-side <code>Game</code> handler and start them all up
automagically. When a client creates a game, it specifies the class name
of the handler for that game, then the server loads that class and
instantiates it.

<p><b>WordGame me this</b><br>

Before I get into the mechanics of this game implementation, I suppose I
should explain the game for those of you who've never played or heard of
WordGame (classic as it may be).

<p><table align=right hspace=3 vspace=3>
<tr><td align=center bgcolor="#99CC66"><font size="-1"><b>A sample WordGame board</b></font></td>
<tr><td><img src="board.gif"></td>
<tr><td bgcolor="#99CC66">&#160</td>
</table>

The game starts by "rolling" a bunch of dice with letters on their sides
and arranging them into a <a href="07.html" target="define"><b>5x5
grid</b></a><sup>7</sup> for all to see. Then a three-minute timer starts
and everyone frantically writes down as many words as they can construct
from adjacent letters on the 5x5 board. The rules for constructing words
are that the consecutive letters in the word must be next to each other on
the board (diagonal connections are legal) and you can't use the same spot
on the board twice (meaning you can't pass twice through a particular
letter in order to spell your word).

<p>When the three minutes expire, everyone compares their list of words
and any words written down by two or more people are stricken from
everyone's lists. "Words" that <a href="08.html" target="define"><b>aren't
real words</b></a><sup>8</sup> are also stricken from the lists. Then
everyone adds up

<table width=180 align=left>
<tr><td width=10><br></td>
<td><br><hr size=1><b><tt><font size="+1" face="arial"><i>The PREROUND
state is just a short splash screen that gives the user a moment to
prepare for the WordGame-mania that will shortly
ensue.</i></font></tt><br></b><hr size=1><br></td>
</table>

their scores, one point for four-letter words, two for five, three for
six, five for seven, and 11 for eight. The first person to break 100
points wins (the highest scorer winning when more than one person breaks
100 in the same round).

<p><b>How it works</b><br>

Aside from the plentitude of user-interface code, the game consists mainly
of two classes: <a href="wordgame/WordGame.java"
target="code"><code>WordGame</code></a> and <a href="wordgame/WordGameGame.java"
target="code"><code>WordGameGame</code></a>. The <code>WordGameGame</code>
class runs on the server and coordinates the transition between rounds and
different states in each round. The <code>WordGame</code> class responds to
coordination events from the server and runs the game on the client side.

<p>The game progresses in rounds of three states
each. <code>PREROUND</code>, <code>INROUND</code> and
<code>POSTROUND</code>. The <code>PREROUND</code> state is just a short
splash screen that gives the user a moment to prepare for the WordGame-mania
that will shortly ensue.  The server generates a random board and
transmits it to all the clients (by setting an attribute on the
game-distributed object), then changes the state to
<code>INROUND</code>. At this point, all the clients display the <a
href="wordgame/Board.java" target="code"><code>Board</code></a> and the <a
href="wordgame/WordPanel.java"
target="code"><code>WordPanel</code></a>. This displays the board and
allows users to type in words they see on the board. It's useful to note
that the word panel does not allow users to enter words that cannot be
created from the current board; this checking is implemented in the <a
href="wordgame/Pieces.java" target="code"><code>Pieces</code></a> class. It
does not, however, know anything about the <a href="09.html"
target="define"><b>validity of words</b></a><sup>9</sup>.

<p>The <code>WordPanel</code> also runs the three-minute timer. When the
user's timer has expired, the word panel sends the list of words generated
by the user back to the game handler by setting an attribute on the
game-distributed object. When all the clients have done this, the game
handler transitions the game to the <code>POSTROUND</code> state, combines
the words, removes duplicates and forks off a perl script to look all the
words up in a dictionary. Meanwhile, since the word lists were
communicated via the game-distributed object, all the clients received
each other's word lists. Upon entering the <code>POSTROUND</code> state,
they start up the <a href="wordgame/CrossOutPanel.java"
target="code"><code>CrossOutPanel</code></a> which makes an animated
display of removing duplicate words. As the game handler receives invalid
words back from the perl script, it communicates those invalid words to
the client and the <code>CrossOutPanel</code> crosses those out as well.

<p>When the whole word-validation phase is over, the clients communicate
their respective scores back to the game handler, who determines whether
to enter another round or to enter the <code>GAMEOVER</code> state. This
of course, depends on whether someone has broken 100 points and is not
tied for first.

<p>That about sums up the game implementation. I didn't mention the actual
mechanism used to look up words in the dictionary, but you can peruse the
<a href="validate.pl" target="code">validate.pl</a> script to find out how
that works.

<p><b>Praise for distributed objects</b><br>

As I've said <a href="10.html" target="define"><b>again and
again</b></a><sup>10</sup>, distributed objects make an extremely useful
paradigm for implementing distributed applications. They make it easy to
transmit messages between clients and servers, and they provide
data-sharing among those clients. These two things are common requirements
of distributed software. To top it all off, this all comes in a package
not too different from the object-oriented paradigm with which people are
now becoming comfortable.

<p>So, dust off your editor and write that multiplayer game you've been
thinking about. You've got all the tools you need now, and a nice little
example to boot.
