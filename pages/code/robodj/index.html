<h3>What is it?</h3>

<p> RoboDJ is an unabashed reimplementation of the ever so popular MP3
jukebox wheel written for no other reason than to satisfy my very
particular needs. It has the following features and limitations:

<ul>
  <li><p> The music repository (the mp3 files), the music server and
  the music database (MySQL in my case) are all accessed via the
  network so that they can run on a headless machine wired into one's
  stereo.

  <li><p> The CD importing client and music browsing and queueing
  client can be run on any machine in the network, simultaneously and
  by many people (generally only people on your local area network,
  but you could let people on the Internet control your music server
  if you felt the need).

  <li><p> Music can be imported by any node on the network and is then
  uploaded to the music server.
</ul>

RoboDJ thus manifests itself as a music server, a SQL database and
clients for browsing and importing music that call out to Unix command
line tools to do the CD ripping (cdparanoia) and MP3 encoding (lame).
Uploading music to the music server must currently be done manually (I
use rsync).

<h3>Downloading</h3>

<p> Little attempt has been made to make RoboDJ easy to install, but
if you're crazy enough to want to give it a try, you should download
the source. The source is hosted on Github:

<p><code>% git clone https://github.com/samskivert/robodj.git</code>

<p> Once you have the database set up, a music repository directory
created and everything is working. You can run the clients using Java
Web Start with these links:

<p><a href="chooser.jnlp">Music Chooser</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="importer.jnlp">Music Importer</a>

<p> They will ask for configuration information the first time they
are run (or if they cannot communicate with the music database or
daemon).

<p> RoboDJ is released under the
  <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a>. Stop
  whining, it's good for you. The most recent version of the project
  should always be available <a
