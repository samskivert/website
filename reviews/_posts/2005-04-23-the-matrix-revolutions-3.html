  <p>Having refused to see this in the theaters owing to my profound disappointment with the second film, I finally acquiesced to a viewing with tremendously low expectations and was, in fact, entertained. It&#8217;s still a shame that <em>The Matrix&#8217;s</em> potential to be the <em>Star Wars</em> of our generation was squandered, but I can&#8217;t say that the film is wholly without value.</p>
