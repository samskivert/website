  <p>A purportedly heartwarming film about a 16 year old substitute teacher in rural China hunting for one of her runaway students in a big city. Through a combination of luck and stubbornness, she accomplishes her goal, capturing the sympathy of thousands of city-dwelling television news viewers in the process. Missable.</p>
