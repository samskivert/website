  <p>I&#8217;d like to think that if I were to make a movie, it would turn out a lot like, and of the same caliber as, <cite>Waking Life</cite>. While some films may veil their philosophic explorations and others lack them entirely, <cite>Waking Life</cite> does neither; it lays them right on the table with no fear that they might confuse or rub the viewer the wrong way. By being so bold, the author of this film connected with me in a way that few persons have in real life and in the process, reinforced my resolve to strive for greatness and expanded my understanding of how to do so. This I view as one of the highest forms of achievement. Thank you Richard Linklater.</p>
