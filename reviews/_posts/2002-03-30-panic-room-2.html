  <p>Jodie Foster wasn&#8217;t enough to save this film from the contrivations that flowed freely through its plot and characters. I didn&#8217;t mind overlooking the film&#8217;s total disregard for the laws of physics, but the psycho bus driver and everyones&#8217; complete inability to negotiate were a bit beyond my capacity for suspension of disbelief. That said, I was on the edge of my seat at least a few times, so perhaps I was believing more than I&#8217;d care to admit.</p>
