  <p>Another outstanding movie from a director whose films I&#8217;ve only recently chanced to see, Roman Polanski. Though no holocaust film could ever be characterized as uplifting, this one left me with a feeling of hope for the future of humanity, an admirable achievement in these discouraging times.</p>
