  <p>My experience with platformers on the PlayStation has been limited and unsatisfying. Thus, I had hopes for <cite>Jak and Daxter</cite> that I wouldn&#8217;t go so far as to call high, but perhaps slightly elevated from the average. The brute force of the PS2 was used to good effect, creating sprawling, detailed worlds. Unfortunately, in those highly detailed worlds, one played a game that was often tedious and rarely innovative. If we weren&#8217;t in the midst of a serious video game drought, I would have gladly passed over this blatantly adolescent-targeted game, but in these lean times, one is driven to dire measures in an effort to satisfy the hunger.</p>
