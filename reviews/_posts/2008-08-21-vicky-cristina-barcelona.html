<p>Itâ€™s been a while since I came away from a Woody Allen film without mixed feelings. <cite>Vicky Cristina</cite> seemed to have modest ambitions and achieved them with aplomb. I liked the schtick with the narrator, Barcelona was beautiful, the characters were endearing and believably flawed, the cast was amazing. Having most recently seen Javier Bardem in <cite>No Country for Old Men</cite> I was also in a permanent state of pleasant surprise at his lack of ruthless killing.</p>
