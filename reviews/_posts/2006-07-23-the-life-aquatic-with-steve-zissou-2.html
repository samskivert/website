<p>“Kumar, what were you doing in the freezer? I don’t know, man, I lose my touch, man.” Wes Anderson isn’t quite in the freezer yet, but he seems headed there. I won’t deny that I was entertained; Bill Murray is a funny guy, Wes knows how to write for Owen Wilson, but what the fuck with all the CG fish? The gags mostly fell flat, the egomaniacal, mid-life crisis having, Jacques Cousteau wannabe didn’t make for a very good framework off which to hang a whole film. Bring back Kumar!
