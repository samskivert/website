  <p>Blah, blah, blah. An uninspired, standard-story film with a bunch of uninspired jokes and a trite uninspired plot that was trying so hard to get a &#8220;good&#8221; message across that they had to make fun of themselves for doing it. At least Robin Williams was in the sidekick role and doing a fine job of it, not surprising since he pioneered the damned role in Aladdin and practically every animated film since has done a poor job of me tooing it. Oh yeah, the animation was good.</p>
