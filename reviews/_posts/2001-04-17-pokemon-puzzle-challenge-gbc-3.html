  <p>The basic game idea is a lot of fun (sort of Tetris meets Connect 4 but not exactly). The variations on the theme are a lot of fun. Finding the hidden Pokemon is fun. The whole Pokemon schtick gets a wee bit tiring and the game is a little hard on one&#8217;s thumb, but if you like to have a few Game Boy games around that you can pick up and play while riding the train, this is a good choice.</p>
