  <p>Directed by Stacy Peralta, this documentary tells the tale of the Zephyr surf team&#8217;s foray into skateboarding and the birth of the sport as it is widely practiced today. My first board being a Powell Peralta, I was fascinated by this peek into the history of skating, more so because I skated for so long without ever giving the first thought to who founded the sport or even who made the gear I was using. Given the peculiar cast of characters and the wildy disparate life paths followed by the original members of the team, I imagine this film would even be worthwhile for non-skaters, though perhaps better caught on cable than the big screen. After all, that&#8217;s more in the spirit of the skate videos which, aside from <cite>Gleaming the Cube</cite> were previously the only window into the wacky world of skateboarding.</p>
