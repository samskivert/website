<p>I backed into type classes via Scala’s <a href="http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/talks/wg2.8-boston06.pdf">poor man</a> implementation thereof. Thus it is illuminating to see them formulated as ML modules, even though I’m not particularly familiar with ML modules either.</p>
<p>Given the global nature of Haskell’s type classes, a limitation remedied by both this work and Scala’s implicits, I wonder what’s so poor about Scala’s approach. Are there things that are expressible with “real” type classes that are not expressible with implicits? Or maybe it’s just a matter of preserving the holy grail of perfect type inference.</p>
