<tt>It's interesting to note
that at that time there
were very few file
formats that existed
across platforms. There
was GIF, but that was
developed by Compuserve
for the express purpose
of being a good cross
platform graphics format.
MOD files were completely
compatible across the two
platforms for the mere
reason that people wanted
to listen to groovy Amiga
MODs on their clones. </tt>
