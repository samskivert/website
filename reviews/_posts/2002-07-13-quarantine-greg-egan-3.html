  <p>Once again, Egan delivers. This novel is chock full of fantastic ideas. Advanced technologies set the backdrop for drama in a credible future where the universe has taken a turn for the peculiar. I&#8217;m continually amazed at Egan&#8217;s ability to extrapolate the cutting edge of modern science into a future that feels so right yet boggles the mind.</p>
