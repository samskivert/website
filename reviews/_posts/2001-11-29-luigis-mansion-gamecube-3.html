  <p>As stunning as the lighting and particle effects are in this game, the thing I enjoyed most was the sound. You have Luigi nervously whistling and humming the theme song, and there are all the great haunted house noises that clang and bump seemingly right over your shoulder thanks to apt use of Dolby surround. The sound and visuals combine to give you a good scare every time a ghost jumps out and starts doing its ghostly business, though it helps if you play late at night. While the game play was straightforward and the puzzles not overly challenging, the game was never tedious and the multitude of unique ghosts kept things interesting from start to finish.</p>
