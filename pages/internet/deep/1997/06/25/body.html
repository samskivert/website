<I>What, it's Wednesday already? Sorry, but our fine staff of Deep Magic
writers is deep in the midst of other magic-making at the moment. But take
heart; their incantations are sure to enhance your future enjoyment of the
go2net site and the MetaCrawler. Besides, your Hamachi is a goner by now -
go clone another one.</I>

<p>
The <a href="/internet/sequitur/1997/06/16/body.html">Tamagotchi</a> craze is sweeping across the nation.  In a quiet
ground swell all over the world, programmers are delving deeply into the
care, feeding and development of virtual pets.  I am, of course, no exception.  My
virtual-pet experiences began in the early 1980s with a program
called "House-on-a-Disk."  I have since experienced the joys of <a href="http://www.dogz.com" target="_blank">Dogz</a>, 
Catz, and a host of other electronic beings.  It's surprisingly 

entertaining to welcome another creature into your computer, and undoubtedly
a broadening experience to share your monitor's real estate with someone 
(or something) else.  My recent experiences with a real-world
<a href="http://www.bandai.com/release.shtml" target="_blank">Tamagotchi</a>
 prompted me to create my own fuzzy, lovable virtual pet, 
which I hereby dub <a href="01.html" target="define"><b>Hamachi</b></a><sup>1</sup>.
<p>
Any similarities between the Java toy enclosed in this article and another 
fashionable, much-sought-after, plastic-based virtual pet are hereby declared
to be purely coincidental.  Although I bear the brunt of the responsibility 
for said implementation, I will tell anyone willing to listen that
the actual coding was done by a group of approximately 100 monkeys.  <table width=180 align=right>

These lower-echelon primates were locked in a room with several bunches of 
bananas and a bank of computer terminals.  Once the supply of bananas was 
exhausted, the room was unlocked and the software was declared finished.  
If you feel your rights have been infringed upon in some way, don't sue me; 
sue the monkeys.

<b>Hamachi, the Wonder Hamster</b><br>
And now, the main attraction; the <a href="ex_normal.html" target="define">Hamachi Java applet</a>.  The
virtual pet living within is an unusual hamster-like creature.   As anyone
who
has ever owned a hamster knows, a hamster's only goal in life is to
escape from its cage.  The hamster-derivative I have captured for your
enjoyment is content to reside in the applet as long as its needs are 
satisfied.  If, however, it becomes restless or unhappy with your 
care-taking efforts, it will likely chew its way out of the cage and 
venture forth into the harsh, cruel world.

<p>
Figure 1 shows the expected growth chart for your Hamachi.  Unlike some
virtual pets, this one remains true to the biological and genetic<table width=180 align=right>
<tr><td width=10><br></td><td><br><hr size=1><b><tt><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="ARIAL"><I>If, however, it becomes restless or unhappy with your

makeup of the hamster.  Perhaps some people enjoy owning and playing
with the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Castle/1999/masuku.htm" target="_blank">spindly-legged beasts</a> found in other virtual-pet
implementations, but I've always preferred more visually-pleasing animals.
<p>
Maintain your Hamachi's well-being and you will see it develop from a 
wee thing into a full-fledged furry companion.  One day in our world is 
equivalent to a month of the hamster's time.  If you care well for your 
hamster, it can live more than <a href="03.html" target="define"><b>20 "months"</b></a><sup>2</sup>.
<p>
<table cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 border=0>
<tr><td><img src="/internet/deep/1997/06/25/fig1.gif" border=0></td>
<tr><td><tt>Figure 2</tt></td>
</table>
<p>
The user-interface for Hamachi is simple.  As seen in Figure 2, the three 
purple buttons are used to select and perform all available actions.  In 
most situations, the "A" button will highlight the action you wish to 
perform, the "B" button will perform the highlighted action, and the 
"C" button will attempt to cancel the currently executing action.  If no 
action is highlighted and the "B" button is pressed, a digital clock will 
be displayed.  Yes, the Hamachi can double as a timepiece!  Will wonders
never cease?
<p>
There are six small action icons in the Hamachi display, again seen in 
Figure 2.  Although they are fairly self-explanatory, brief explanations
are as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li>"Food" allows you to give the hamster a meal, decreasing its
hunger.  
<li>"Lights" toggles the cage illumination on and off.  You should
turn the lights off when the hamster is sleeping in order to keep it in
good spirits.  The hamster has regular waking/sleeping hours; you would do
well to familiarize yourself with them.
<li>"Play" begins a game with the hamster.  The hamster will roll
left or right in its hamster ball; you must guess in which direction it will
roll.  Press the "A" button if you think it will roll left; 
"B" if you think it will roll right.  If you guess correctly,
the hamster will gain happiness.
<li>"Clean" will clean the cage of any excrement the hamster may
have deposited.  If the cage is dirty, the hamster may become unhappy.  
<li>"Status" displays the hamster's current information (age in
"months," weight in grams, happiness, hunger.)
<li>"Attention" is highlighted when the hamster is particularly
needy; i.e., if it is very hungry and has been neglected for quite some
time.  You should seek to address its concerns as soon as possible.
</ul>

<p>
The hamster is a hardy, robust pet; and hence it can survive a goodly amount
of experimental or accidental clicking.  Go forth and enjoy!
<p>
For those impatient souls who would rather not endure a real-world
20-day wait to discover the entirety of the joy that is Hamachi, there
is a drastically more <a href="ex_fast.html" target="define">rapidly-evolving Hamachi applet</a> as well.  Note
that you must also care for this Hamachi at an increased rate so as to 
compensate for its rapid development.  If you download the source code to
the applet, you can specify the execution rate by changing the <table width=180 align=right>
<tr><td width=10><br></td><td><br><hr size=1><b><tt><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="ARIAL"><I>An alpaca-based virtual pet, for instance, might have a "Rocketry" action that would allow it to launch software engineers high into the atmosphere, only to watch them come
plummeting down to Earth once more.</I></FONT></tt><br></b><hr size=1><br></td></table>
<font face="courier">msPerMin</font> parameter in the HTML file.  Be careful, though; if you set it too small, you'll find yourself watching the Hamachi wither 
and die before your very eyes.
<p>
<b>the making of Hamachi</b><br>
My implementation is based on <a href="http://www.research.ukans.edu/animal/chap4.html" target="_blank">rigorous research</a> into
the lifestyle and habits of real-world hamsters.  I have also incorporated
some experiences with my previous pet hamster, <a href="02.html" target="define"><b>Tatanka</b></a><sup>3</sup>.  Indeed, 
Hamachi's likeness is patterned after Tatanka's, although the limited 
resolution of Hamachi's imitation LCD loses some detail.  
<p>
I've avoided touting Java's abilities thus far, but a brief 
digression on the benefits of virtual-pet implementation in Java seems
a necessity.  Java's cross-platform nature allows developers to target the 
widest possible audience of pet-owners.  Furthermore, embedding applets in
web
pages makes it easy to dispense Java-based pets to all your friends; 
just mail them <a href="ex_normal.html" target="define">the URL</a>.  Multiple pets may even be instantiated in 
separate browser (or <font face="courier">appletviewer</font>) windows.  Just try
that with a real-world pet!
<p>
Having implemented one virtual pet, I now feel prepared to suffer through the
<a href="http://www.comedia.com/Hot/jargon_3.0/JARGON_S/SCND_SYS.HTML" target="_blank">second-system effect</a>.  Hamachi is lacking some niceties present in other pets; i.e., illness, punishment facilities, and behavioral 
modification.  Higher-quality graphics, sound, and new animal-species implementations are some other excellent future development directions.  An alpaca-based virtual pet, for instance, might have a "Rocketry" action that would allow it to launch software engineers high into the atmosphere, only to watch them come 
plummeting down to Earth once more.  Rollicking-good, clean fun
awaits us all, if we can only find time to bring our imaginative creations to light.
<p>
Hamachi is <a href="04.html" target="define"><b>virtually living proof</b></a><sup>4</sup> that Java-based pets can be 
friendly, manageable and well-behaved.  As <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/track5.html#embed" target="_blank">JavaSoft would have it</a>, we 
may eventually see pets like this one popping up in cellular 
telephones, toasters, and even on dog collars.  Regardless of the locale, such
model citizens of cyberspace are sure to be loved by all, so get one while 
the getting's good!
