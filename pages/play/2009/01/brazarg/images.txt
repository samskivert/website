title Salvador, Brazil
image salvador/IMG_1723.JPG Our first sights in Salvador on the way into town from the airport. Very blocky.
image salvador/IMG_1730.JPG We arrived at our very charming hotel and climbed a spiral staircase to the room.
image salvador/IMG_1726.JPG Where we found a lovely view of the industrial port. If it hadn't been 90 degrees, I might have thought I was in Vladivostok.
image salvador/IMG_1728.JPG But at least we had a nice pool in which to float while taking in the view.
image salvador/IMG_1733.JPG The view from the bar was much nicer.
image salvador/IMG_1735.JPG Somewhat delirious from jetlag and our first (incredibly strong) caipirinha, we wandered into the crowded streets.
image salvador/IMG_1737.JPG Where we found strange works of art.
image salvador/IMG_1739.JPG Gracefully aging churches.
image salvador/IMG_1740.JPG Fading pastel colonial architecture.
image salvador/IMG_1742.JPG A funicular!
image salvador/IMG_1746.JPG And we found out what Santa gets up to the other eleven months of the year.
image salvador/IMG_1749.JPG The squares were densely populated with vendors intent that you not suffer for too long without a cocktail in your hand.
image salvador/IMG_1750.JPG There were also many stray cats.
image salvador/IMG_1755.JPG And inscrutable public art.
image salvador/IMG_1762.JPG I much preferred the graffiti, which was stylish and sophisticated.
image salvador/IMG_1763.JPG Here we have a scathing condemnation of the impact of gender roles among the bovine population of urban Brazil.
image salvador/IMG_1765.JPG Here we have a polka dot building.
image salvador/IMG_1780.JPG Here we have a reminder that Jesus died for our sins.
image salvador/IMG_1772.JPG The central area of Salvador is split quite dramatically between an uptown and a downtown.
image salvador/IMG_1768.JPG Eventually we made our way down the hill to a big market by the harbor.
image salvador/IMG_1770.JPG Under which were spooky catacombs wherein slaves were once traded.
image salvador/IMG_1783.JPG There was more excellent urban art down the hill.
image salvador/IMG_1785.JPG On the day before we left, the entire town took the day off and had a giant party. Not on account of our departure, I presume.
image salvador/IMG_1790.JPG At the party we bumped into Barack Obama's secret younger brother. Unfortunately I didn't get a clearer shot of him. The secret service mind control rays were probably interfering with the camera.
title Morro de Sao Paolo, Brazil
image morro/IMG_1812.JPG We then hopped onto this tiny plane and flew to the nearby island of Morro de Sao Paolo. Anita didn't like the idea of taking the two hour boat ride. By the end of the brief but bumpy plane trip, she was a much bigger fan of boat travel.
image morro/IMG_1797.JPG We had to make hotel reservations at the last minute. After five phone calls that exhausted my tiny Portuguese vocabulary, we ended up at the modest, but plucky Village Paraiso Tropical.
image morro/IMG_1795.JPG It wasn't posh, but the bar by the beach was quite nice.
image morro/IMG_1801.JPG Here we see the two main modes of transportation on the island: foot and tractor.
image morro/IMG_1800.JPG Some local charm: a fishing scow and butts.
image morro/IMG_1808.JPG As is my habit, I spent some of my time on the island upside down.
title Buenos Aires, Argentina
image sanisidro/IMG_1824.JPG We then departed Brazil and headed to Buenos Aires. Our first stop was San Isidro, a sort of Argentinian Beverly Hills. We were staying in a colonial mansion that had been converted into a hotel.
image sanisidro/IMG_1816.JPG The room was tastefully decorated.
image sanisidro/IMG_1825.JPG Jesus was on the job nearby.
image sanisidro/IMG_1835.JPG Food in Brazil ranged from "not very good" to "gives you food poisoning", so we were ecstatic to be somewhere that we could order a salad. The salads at this charming little bistro were worth writing home about.
image sanisidro/IMG_1827.JPG We became very familiar with our local stop on the Tren de la Costa, because it turns out that San Isidro is a long way from anything interesting.
image sanisidro/IMG_1828.JPG The train, on the other hand, was quite interesting.
image sanisidro/IMG_1830.JPG Not to be outdone by Brazil, Argentina had a respectable supply of stray cats on display.
image palermo/IMG_1841.JPG Eventually we made our way to the Plaza de Mayo, wherein the tourists and government officials rubbed elbows.
image palermo/IMG_1846.JPG Said government officials all worked in the Pink House. Perhaps President Obama will take home some exterior decorating ideas from his next state visit to Argentina.
image palermo/IMG_1844.JPG Tucked into a nearby courtyard, Baby Jesus could be seen cavorting with every kind of ruminant to be found within five hundred miles of the fertile crescent.
image palermo/IMG_1856.JPG I eventually turned my attention to the local wildlife.
image palermo/IMG_1850.JPG The most popular species of which was canis lupus familiaris. There were more pet stores in Buenos Aires than there are Starbucks in Seattle.
image palermo/IMG_1859.JPG Touring around the city on foot, we saw thin towers...
image palermo/IMG_1857.JPG ...twisty trees...
image palermo/IMG_1858.JPG ...and more pink.
image palermo/IMG_1860.JPG We stopped in at the MALBA.
image palermo/IMG_1861.JPG Where the architecture was more interesting than the art.
image palermo/IMG_1863.JPG Departing the museum we had to cross this perilously wide street.
image palermo/IMG_1862.JPG On the other side we encountered a fleet of scooters ready and waiting to deliver icy cold relief to desperate Argentinians suffering in the heat.
image santelmo/IMG_1865.JPG We relocated to San Telmo (after a few days in Palermo wherein I seem to have taken no photos). From our balcony we were greeted by the full majesty of central Buenos Aires.
image santelmo/IMG_1879.JPG San Telmo had some lovely local markets.
image santelmo/IMG_1900.JPG And gnomes.
image santelmo/IMG_1875.JPG And more excellent graffiti.
image santelmo/IMG_1903.JPG Much of it was abstract.
image santelmo/IMG_1905.JPG Some with a cubist influence.
image santelmo/IMG_1901.JPG And some more minimalist.
image santelmo/IMG_1880.JPG We discovered in our wanderings that Buenos Aires has streets named for every country in the Americas. Eventually we found the one for the good old US of A. Not very glamorous.
image santelmo/IMG_1881.JPG My white linen pants had been dreaming of this trip ever since they joined my wardrobe.
image santelmo/IMG_1884.JPG San Telmo was a happening spot in the early 1900s, then everyone fled due to a cholera outbreak. In the intervening 100 years it's become a bit rougher around the edges, but hasn't lost its charm.
image santelmo/IMG_1891.JPG They do, however, seem to have forgotten that very important lesson about infectious disease.
image santelmo/IMG_1892.JPG In places, echoes linger of a more erudite age.
image santelmo/IMG_1894.JPG One day, we headed toward the Recoleta, where the rich relocated after the cholera. Along the way we encountered experimental new advertising techniques.
image santelmo/IMG_1908.JPG We also encountered very impressive residences.
image santelmo/IMG_1937.JPG Our destination that day was an enormous cemetery. Just before we arrived, we encountered an even more enormous tree.
image santelmo/IMG_1936.JPG The trunk was fenced off, perhaps to spare this ancient beast the indignity of having teenagers carve their fleeting passions into its roots.
image santelmo/IMG_1910.JPG As we wandered in search of dead people, I eventually spied this pious image and suspected we were on the right track.
image santelmo/IMG_1911.JPG It's hard to convey the size of this cemetery. There were dozens of little alleys branching every-which way. It was a sprawling metropolis of death.
image santelmo/IMG_1916.JPG Here we catch Anita gently rapping, rapping at the chamber door.
image santelmo/IMG_1917.JPG I didn't frame this shot intentionally. Clearly it's a sign from the heavens.
image santelmo/IMG_1921.JPG This was a not so successful attempt to have my ghostly visage appear to descend the stairs into the tomb below.
image santelmo/IMG_1924.JPG Creepy spider webs were in plentiful supply. I thought they made that up in vampire movies, but spiders really do love crypts.
image santelmo/IMG_1926.JPG This filing cabinet for corpses had lost a door. I waited expectantly for the lid to slide slowly off the coffin and a withered hand to reach out, but no such luck.
image santelmo/IMG_1930.JPG Many tombs had angels and other heavenly figures gracing their exteriors.
image santelmo/IMG_1929.JPG And the Burton family has a plot here in Buenos Aires it seems.
image santelmo/IMG_1896.JPG During the entire trip, the weather forecast had been incorrectly predicting rain. Just before we left, they finally got it right.
image santelmo/IMG_1897.JPG When the rain finally stopped, we were treated to this cheerful sight, with which I'll end this photo tour. So long Argentina and thanks for all the sweets.
