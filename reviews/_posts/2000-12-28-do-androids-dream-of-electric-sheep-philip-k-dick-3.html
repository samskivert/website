  <p>Having seen Blade Runner before reading the book, I was expecting something with the dramatic density of the film. While I did find that to be lacking, the book stood on its own as a fine piece of science fiction and the depth afforded by the written word more than made up for the lesser emotional impact of the story line. That said, I have even more respect for the author of the Blade Runner screenplay because I feel that they actually improved upon an impressive piece of work in translating it to film.</p>
