  <p>I lament all the effort that goes into creating lush, beautiful environments and the rendering engines that can handle them while gameplay and story languish on the sidelines. However, in this case, the reasonably standard Zelda-style action-adventure action was fun, and the tolerable dialogue and storyline didn&#8217;t manage to stand in the way of my enjoying the experience. Taking pictures of things was neat too, though I did a lot more of that in <cite>Wind Waker</cite>.</p>
