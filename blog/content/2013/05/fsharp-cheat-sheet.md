title: F# Cheat Sheet

I was looking for a good F# cheat sheet and found a nice one originally published by a6systems,
which has since disappeared from the Internet.

I wasted thirty minutes of my life trying to track down a copy of the PDF. I found half a dozen
sites that linked to the defunct original website, and a quarter dozen "document hosting" sites
that insisted I register with them to download the damned thing. It's always depressing to bump
into this part of the Internet.

I'm posting the cheat sheet here in the hope that it will save future people the frustration:

  * [a6systems F# cheat sheet](/code/fsharp/fsharp-cheat-sheet.pdf)

If anyone knows of a better one that summarizes the essential syntax bits on one or two pages,
please send it my way!
