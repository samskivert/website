<p>
  That's Enormous is packaged as a <a href="enormous.zip">Mac OS app</a>,
  or you can run it via Java Web Start via <a href="enormous.jnlp">this link</a>
  but Java security restrictions default to not allowing self-signed apps any more
  so that may not work. Worst case, download <a href="enormous.jar">enormous.jar</a>
  and run it from the command line via: <code>java -jar enormous.jar</code>.

<p><b>Instructions</b><br>

The moderator can click on any of the questions to activate that question.

<p> While a question is activated, pressing 1, 2, or 3 will cause the
associated player to "respond". For that real game show feel, you will
want buzzer peripherals which can be plugged into the USB port and
generate a key event when pressed.

<p> That player would then respond to the question and the moderator would
then select:

<ul>
<li> <b>y</b> to indicate that they got the question right which will
score points for that player

<li> <b>n</b> to indicate they got it wrong which will penalize that
player's score and allow the question to be answered by the other players

<li> <b>c</b> to "cancel" the selection (the "responder" scores no
negative points and the question becomes once again answerable by any of
the players)

<li> or click the mouse on the question box to dismiss the question
entirely (if no player responds within some desired time frame, for
example).
</ul>

<p> Click on any of the team displays at the bottom of the screen to
configure the active player for that team. Any previously active player
will have their score reset, but any stars they earned will be remembered
as long as that player is reinstated with the exact same name next time
they are up to play.

<p> Hold down the shift key and click on any of the team displays at the
bottom of the screen to "cash in" points for that player and award them
and their team stars. 6 points is worth one star, 9 points two, 12 three,
and so on.

<p> A player's personal stars are tracked as well. Click any of the
category boxes at the top of the screen to display the current status of
all players up to this point. Click that display to return to the current
round.

<p> Hold down the shift key and click the category boxes at the top of the
screen to end the current round which will also display the per-player
status up to this point. Then click that display to start the next round.

<p><b>Configuration</b><br>

Look at the sample configuration files for information on configuring a game:

<ul>
<li> <a href="enormous.properties">enormous.properties</a>
<li> <a href="questions.properties">questions.properties</a>
</ul>

Create a directory on your desktop named "enormous" and place the
configuration files and all associated media files in that directory
and the game will locate it when started.
