<p>Such an extraordinary film. The brilliant choice of mixing a fairy tale with the real world repression and terror following the Spanish civil war reminded me of the similarly amazing film La Vita Ã¨ Bella. Experiencing such a deft and poignant blend of fantasy and historical drama makes me almost embarrassed to have enjoyed such comparative fluff as the Harry Potter films. For penance, I vow to read something long and brooding by Dostoevsky.
