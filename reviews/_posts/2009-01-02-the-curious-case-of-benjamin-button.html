<p>Occasionally it was charming and more frequently the scenery was nice, but the plot was all over the place and the characters never really cohered. Nothing about the film ever offended, but it was very schticky. The whole sliding doors sequence was totally gratuitous. The strangest thing about the film was that they did a better job making Brad Pitt look young than Cate Blanchett look old.</p>
