  <p>My comments must be taken with a grain of salt since I saw the film in Japanese and my grasp of that language is on the low end of passable. However, I got the feeling that this worked to my benefit as the spectacular visuals and anime-style action scenes seemed to be the film&#8217;s main strengths. Even without understanding a word, it was obvious that the director ended the film with a painfully heavy handed bout of trite moralization. If it makes it to DVD in the States, try turning off the subtitles and maybe smoking something.</p>
