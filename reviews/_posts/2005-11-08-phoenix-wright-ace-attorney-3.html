	<p>A quirky game where you play a defense attorney and investigate crimes for clues that help you to defend your clients. The game play is nothing to write home about (conversation trees, annoying “click everything until you figure out what’s important”), but the stories are amusing and there was enough wackiness to keep me engaged to the bitter end.
