  <p>This film managed to steer well clear of ever making any sense, for which I wouldn&#8217;t condemn it outright, but <cite>Arizona Dream</cite> felt more like a transparent attempt at being wacky than an inscrutable glimpse at a greater whole. Depp was inexperienced and uninspiring. Jerry Lewis, in the part of the Cadillac selling uncle, was fantastic, but aside from a few classic Lewis maneuvers, his talents were largely underutilized. The film simply failed to deliver as anything more than a collection of scenes running the gamut from absurd to zany.</p>
