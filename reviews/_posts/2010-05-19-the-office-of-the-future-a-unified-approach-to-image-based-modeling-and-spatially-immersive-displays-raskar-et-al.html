<p>An early kitchen sink paper on how to use projectors and cameras to do a bunch of stuff: augment physical spaces with projected graphics, locate and track objects and people, seamlessly combine overlapping projected images, capture depth information, imperceptibly project structured light onto surfaces, and other things I’m probably forgetting. The technology is all neat, but I’m not that excited about the things they proposed doing with it. Unlike most HCI researchers, I don’t really like projected displays.</p>
