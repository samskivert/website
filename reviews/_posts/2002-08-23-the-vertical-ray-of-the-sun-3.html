  <p>A stunningly photographed, sexy, indulgence of a film. Modern Vietnam &#8212; Hanoi in particular &#8212; sets the backdrop for a glimpse at the lives of three sisters and a brother. Lives that are at once familiar, exotic and like most, on the verge of falling apart. We can surely thank the French at least in part for yet another irresistible film about nothing in particular.</p>
