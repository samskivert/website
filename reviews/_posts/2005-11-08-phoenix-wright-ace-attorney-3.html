  <p>A quirky game where you play a defense attorney and investigate crimes for clues that help you to defend your clients. The game play is nothing to write home about (conversation trees, annoying &#8220;click everything until you figure out what&#8217;s important&#8221;), but the stories are amusing and there was enough wackiness to keep me engaged to the bitter end.</p>
