<p>Amazingly, I had never before seen a Soderbergh film. I’m going to hazard a guess that they’re not all as wacky as this one. Schizophrenic as it was, some meaningful emotional impact managed to squeeze through and I came to care about his crazy characters. The generic non-speech was hilarious, the “have one person in every conversation speak in a foreign language” bit was not as amusing. Having seen this side of Mr. Soderbergh, maybe I’ll give in and watch <cite>Ocean’s Eleven</cite>.
