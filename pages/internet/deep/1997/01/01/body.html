<p> Data compression is a necessity nowadays, particularly with the advent of
the Internet and its wealth of information (on <a href="01.html"
target="define"><b>beefalo</b></a><sup>1</sup>, for instance.)  A variety of
popular compression utilities are available for every computing platform,
utilizing such diverse algorithms as <a
href="http://spwww.mcit.med.umich.edu/projects/video/tech/compress.html"
target="_blank">Huffman</a>, <a
href="http://spwww.mcit.med.umich.edu/projects/video/tech/compress.html"
target="_blank">Lempel-Ziv</a>, and a multitude of variants thereof.  In this
article we take a close look at an elementary algorithm called <a
href="http://cs.wpi.edu/~matt/courses/cs563/talks/gformats.html"
target="_blank">Run-Length Encoding</a> in order to better understand some of
the principles behind compression.  We then examine a more complex algorithm
called Huffman compression.

<p> Compression has been used since computers were first applied to
large-scale data manipulation tasks.  It is important to bear in mind that the
success of a compression algorithm is heavily dependent on the data being
compressed; that is, one compression algorithm may compress a specific set of
data extremely well, while the same algorithm applied to other data may either
fail to reduce the data size at all, or perhaps even increase the data size.

<p> We illustrate our compression algorithm discussion with live
demonstrations written in Java.  These demonstrations will more clearly show
the process which takes place when data is compressed and decompressed, while
also pointing out some of the strengths and weaknesses of the presented
algorithms.

<p> <b>Run Long, Run Deep</b>

<p> Run-Length Encoding (RLE) is one of the simplest compression techniques.
This algorithm simply analyzes the data to be compressed, looking for <a
href="02.html" target="define"><b>runs</b></a><sup>2</sup> of repeated
characters; it then stores these runs as a single character, preceded by a
number representing the number of times this character is repeated in the run.
Note that random data will not compress well; if there are no runs of repeated
characters, this algorithm (implemented intelligently) cannot perform any
compression at all.  Implemented poorly, RLE will increase the data size
(i.e., the string &quot;ABAB&quot; will become &quot;1A1B1A1B&quot;, twice the
length of the original!)

<p> The RLE compression algorithm steps are:

<ol>
<li> Step through the source data from beginning to end, watching for repeated
     sequences of characters.
<li> Build the compressed data string as we read our source data:
   <ol>
   <li> As we find each lone character (or sequences of run length = 2),
        we see we cannot benefit by compressing them (as it requires at
        least two characters to store an encoded representation), and so
        we simply append them to the end of our compressed data string.
   <li> Runs of data are changed into a (number, character) pair,
        where number represents the length of the run.  This pair is
        then appended to the end of our compressed data string.
   </ol>
</ol>

<p> Assume, for simplicity, that our input alphabet consists of only the
characters 'A' and 'B'.  We can then represent our data using a bitmap image.
We choose to represent 'A' with black bits and B with blue bits.  Since
compressed data is stored using the (number, character) pair mentioned above,
we also use the digits '0' through '9', displayed as yellow bits, to denote
(only in compressed data) the run length of the character following the digit.
Using this representation, we can demonstrate a <a href="03.html"
target="define"><b>very successful</b></a><sup>3</sup> application of RLE
compression.  A <a href="04.html" target="define"><b>somewhat
successful</b></a><sup>4</sup> compression job is more common, and if we are
particularly unlucky we may be faced with some cases of <a href="05.html"
target="define"><b>incompressible data</b></a><sup>5</sup>.

<p> RLE has the advantage of being simple to implement, but it is incapable of
achieving high levels of compression for most data.  Although some graphics
images may compress well using RLE, most textual data does not contain long
runs of repeated characters (unless one is compressing a <a href="06.html"
target="define"><b>cartoon script</b></a><sup>6</sup>, with frequent
exclamations such as, "Aiyeeeeeeeeee.........".)  We certainly wouldn't deign
to forbid the application of RLE to such glamorous writings as these.

<p> <b>Mind Your Tries and Queues</b>

<p> Compression algorithms grow rapidly more complex.  In order to achieve
better data space savings, additional data structures and data analysis are
often utilized.  The Huffman compression algorithm, described by D. Huffman in
1952, achieves much better compression by taking into account the frequency
with which characters appear in the input data.  However, in order to do this,
the algorithm must make use of a <a href="07.html" target="define"><b>priority
queue</b></a><sup>7</sup> and an <a href="08.html" target="define"><b>encoding
trie</b></a><sup>8</sup>, while also analyzing the data in much more depth
than is necessary in RLE compression.

<p> The Huffman compression algorithm consists of the following steps:

<ol><li>Count the frequency of each character in the source data.
    <li>Insert the character frequencies into a priority queue allowing the
        removal of the minimal-frequency element present in the queue.
    <li>Build an optimal encoding trie from the priority queue.
    <li>Generate minimal bit-length codes representing each character in the
        source data.
    <li>Translate each character in our source data into its equivalent
        code representation.
</ol>

<p> Huffman compression thus achieves its data savings by enabling characters
to be represented by a smaller sequence of bits.  <img src="figure1.gif"
align=left hspace=10 vspace=5  alt="[sample encoding trie image]"> In textual data, a normal character is commonly
stored as 1 byte (8 bits), or 2 bytes (16 bits) for <a href="09.html"
target="define"><b>Unicode</b></a><sup>9</sup> characters.  We consider only
1-byte characters hereafter (and in our Huffman applet as well.)  Using the
encoding trie, the most frequently-appearing characters in the source data are
located near the root of the trie, resulting in a shorter bit encoding.  The
most common characters may have an encoding of only one or two bits, versus 8
bits without compression.

<p> The optimal placement of frequently-accessed characters in the encoding
trie is due to the way in which step 3, above, is performed.  Huffman
discovered a way to create an encoding trie, based on particular input data,
which results in a bit string of minimal length representing the input data.
To build the optimal encoding trie:

<img src="figure2.gif" align=right vspace=5 alt="[ex. creation of encoding trie image]">
<ol><li>Remove the two smallest frequencies from the priority queue.
    <li>Create a new element with a frequency equal to the sum of both
        elements, make the two removed elements children of the new element,
        and place the new element in the priority queue.
    <li>Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the priority queue is empty.
</ol>

<p> In order to decompress the data, we need to store the final character
codes generated in step 4 of the main Huffman compression
algorithm. Therefore, for input data which results in a large trie (and thus
large bit-encodings), we must have a sufficiently large quantity of data to be
compressed so as to make up for the size of the code <a href="10.html"
target="define"><b>storage space</b></a><sup>10</sup>.  Since the space
required by the codes is negligible when we have a large amount of relatively
compressible input data, we disregard it in calculating the compression
savings for our Huffman applets below.  One should keep in mind, though, that
for very small quantities of input data the encoding trie storage space may
render Huffman compression ineffective.

<p> If there are a number of redundant characters in the data to be
compressed, Huffman can save <a href="11.html" target="define"><b>quite a bit
of space</b></a><sup>11</sup>.  If all characters present in the string are <a
href="12.html" target="define"><b>equally represented</b></a><sup>12</sup>,
our compression savings decrease, although we still save a great deal.  In
fact, most textual data will achieve compression of at least 40% to 50% with
Huffman compression (yes, even text like <a href="13.html"
target="define"><b>"Aiyeeee."</b></a><sup>13</sup>) Unlike RLE, the level of
compression is <a href="14.html" target="define"><b>totally
unrelated</b></a><sup>14</sup> to the ordering of the characters in the data.
Huffman compression is clearly superior to RLE compression for most textual
data, but it is far more complex to implement and the actual
compression/decompression process takes longer.

<p> <b>Other Data-Squishing Methodology</b>

<p> Although we've presented an <a href="15.html"
target="define"><b>amazing</b></a><sup>15</sup> amount of information thus
far, even compression has its limits.  We therefore end our discussion with a
brief look at related topics and future research possibilities for the
interested reader.

<p> The trie data structure is useful in many other areas, such as storing
large quantities of information while allowing rapid lookup (i.e.,
computerized dictionaries, libraries, etc.)  Both the <a href="16.html"

structure.

<p><a href="http://spwww.mcit.med.umich.edu/projects/video/tech/compress.html"
target="_blank">Lempel-Ziv</a> compression schemes (the two most common
variants being LZ77 and LZ78) are the next logical step in our look at data
compression algorithms.  There are several pointers in this article to more
information on Lempel-Ziv, and <a href="http://quest.jpl.nasa.gov/zlib/"
target="_blank">free source code</a> is also available demonstrating one
possible implementation.
