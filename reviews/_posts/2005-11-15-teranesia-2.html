  <p>Not Egan&#8217;s best work. His more recent novels are full of interesting ideas, this has one moderately interesting idea. There&#8217;s a protein that uses quantum effects to &#8220;search&#8221; DNA mutation space for modifications that increase fitness. And the characters are annoying.</p>
