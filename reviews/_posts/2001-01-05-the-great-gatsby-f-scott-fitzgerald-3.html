  <p>I very much like Fitzgerald&#8217;s style of writing. His sense of humor had me laughing out loud repeatedly. The story read easily, flowing from the pages like a rushing stream. The ideas harmonized with my world view in ways that were unique to the American experience and ways unique to my own life experience.</p>
