  <p>What a lackluster attempt to bring the brilliant Warioland series from the GameBoy to the GameCube. It&#8217;s not a bad game, but it doesn&#8217;t control quite right, its side-scrolling nature feels like a annoying restriction rather than a sensible game design choice, and whacking bad guys isn&#8217;t nearly as much fun as Warioland-style puzzly platform action.</p>
