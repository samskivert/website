title: "Stages of Design in Technology for Global Development – Donner, et. al"
category: papers

<p>Proposes a series of stages through which most ICT4D (information and communication technologies for development) projects progress: wonder, exuberance, realization, adaptation, identification. What could possibly go wrong with throwing a bunch of researchers (who probably haven’t spent a lot of time outside the academic environment in their native countries) out into the third world and then letting them come up with technological solutions to the problems they encounter? I don’t fault their motivation, but they might benefit by at least running their ideas by battle scarred entrepreneurs working in the areas they target. There’s nothing like trying to sell something to people to teach you what they really care about.</p>
