  <p>Another unfortunate incidence of quantum physics ponied out as some sort of hocus pocus explanation for notions that are at best the realm of psychology or possibly molecular biology. The film was saved by the occasional sense of humor and otherwise good intentions. I don&#8217;t purport to have the key to helping the world to understand that they are in control of the unfathomably complex and magnificent system that is their own body and thus their own destiny, but I certainly would not approach the problem with this kind of hand waving and scientific sounding but otherwise empty discourse. I&#8217;d probably start teaching people physics and they&#8217;d all be asleep in the first fifteen minutes.</p>
