  <p>I finally dug out and plugged in this Intel Play microscope that I picked up on a lark a while back. At 200x it&#8217;s damned near impossible to adjust the cheap plastic platform in increments small enough to get good focus and without decent lighting, it&#8217;s hard to get a good image, but it is pretty neat. After looking at the collection of dog hair and honeybee wings they included in the box, I looked around for something else to jam under there. </p>

<p>This nasty looking business is some cork at 60x:<br />

<p>While disassembling a Nintendo cartridge to see if there was anything interesting inside, I got a good close look at one of the screws:<br />

<p>Then I took a peek at some printed text. I figured that at, say, 600 dpi, I might see some actual dots at 200x magnification. However, it was not to be. Probably they print at a higher resolution like 1200 dpi and the resolution of the microscope is far from stellar:</p>

<p>If I catch any small creatures in my apartment in the near future, you&#8217;ll be sure to get a good close look at them.</p>
