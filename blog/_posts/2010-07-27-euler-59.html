<p><a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=59">Problem 059</a>:</p>
<pre>
object Euler59 extends EulerApp {
  val cipher = readline(&quot;cipher1.txt&quot;) split(&#39;,&#39;) map(_.toInt)
  def decode (cipher :Array[Int], key :Array[Char]) =
    (0 until cipher.length) map(ii =&gt; cipher(ii) ^ key(ii%key.length))
  def answer = (for {
    a &lt;- &#39;a&#39; to &#39;z&#39;; b &lt;- &#39;a&#39; to &#39;z&#39;; c &lt;- &#39;a&#39; to &#39;z&#39;
    val decoded = decode(cipher, Array(a, b, c))
    if (decoded.map(_.toChar).mkString.contains(&quot; chapter&quot;))
  } yield decoded.sum).head
}
</pre>
<p>Nothing fancy here. I do a brute force search, trying each key in turn and looking for a particular English word to indicate that the decoding is correct. I’m cheating a little in that I first had the program print out the decoded text, and once I saw the correct decoding, I selected a word therefrom to use in the final version. I suppose I could read in a dictionary of English words and assume I’d found the key when my decoding contained a few of the words in the dictionary. That sounds like way too much work for an Euler problem.</p>
