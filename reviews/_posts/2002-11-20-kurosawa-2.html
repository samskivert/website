  <p>As a Kurosawa fanboy, I found the biographical information covered in the film interesting and enjoyed it purely for a chance to see the man himself holding interviews. However, for the non-fanboy, I would certainly recommend heeding Kurosawa&#8217;s own advice and concerning yourself with the works and not the creator.</p>
