  <p>A fascinating discussion of many things Murakami by one of his three main translators. Given my current status as a student of Japanese, it&#8217;s fascinating to see &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; on much of Rubin&#8217;s translation. Mainly it serves to underscore how much I have yet to learn about the language.</p>
