  <p>Director Wong Kar-wai is the mack daddy. This film has style enough to slap it up, flip it and rub it down. I had no idea how well Hong Kong and the sixties went together. If you go see the movie after reading this commentary, count how many different dresses the female lead wears because I&#8217;m curious.</p>
