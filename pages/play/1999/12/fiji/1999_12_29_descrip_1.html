<font size="-1">some neat pink flower that we saw on the way into the building. upon arriving at the building we discovered that the garden had just closed. we even gave one of the ladies that worked there a ride back to her village. fijians do a lot of walking and they sure seem to appreciate a lift when they can get it.</font>
