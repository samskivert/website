  <p>If you ever form words into a sentence with the intent of their being read by another individual, read this book. Seemingly every instance where writing has rubbed me the wrong way as a reader is tidily addressed in Elements explaining why it&#8217;s bad style and how to remedy it. On top of that, the authors live by their own rules and manage to find room for a liberal dose of humor that make this literary medicine go down that much easier.</p>
