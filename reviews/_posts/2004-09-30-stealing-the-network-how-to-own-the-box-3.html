  <p>An interesting, if not expertly written, set of stories about hacking that were fairly entertaining, but mainly reminded me that thanks to complexity and the rapid pace of progress, there&#8217;s not a damned thing I can do to prevent someone from hacking into my networks if they are highly motivated. I&#8217;m sure glad I&#8217;m an optimist.</p>
