  <p>A fine piece of work by a very funny man. Dirk is a great character and I can see why he merited a second book. Unfortunately for Douglas Adams, one can&#8217;t help but compare this to the <cite>H2G2</cite> series, to which it pales (though only a sort of light beige, definitely not a stark white). I giggled, I snickered, I even smirked more than occasionally, but I never fell out of my chair crying and beating my fists against the floor, which I was secretly expecting based on Adams&#8217;s inimitable performance in The Guide.</p>
