<p>Visually spectacular, never lacks a sense of humor, fun to play and a draws deeply from the well of Japanese culture. That Clover was able to cut such a masterpiece from whole cloth rather than working their way up to it like Nintendo did with the Zelda series makes it all the more tragic and absurd that they were shut down just as the game was being released in the US. Iâ€™m sure the people involved will find new places to ply their trade but I can only hope they again have the opportunity to realize such a masterful vision.
