  <p>You need to have achieved the right balance of having wits enough about you to catch the torrent of movie references, but having waylayed your wits sufficiently to let the humor slip past your guard. The thing I appreciated about this film was not that the jokes were especially clever, but that they paid close attention to detail and left no nook empty of tasteless humor. It reminded me of the early Zucker brothers movies that I so adore.</p>
