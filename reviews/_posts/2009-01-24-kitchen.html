<p>I donâ€™t like Yoshimoto as much as I like Murakami, but she has a charming quirkiness and her characters are no less wacky. This book is actually two novelettes. I preferred the surreal mysticism of the latter, Moonlight Story, to the emotional angst of the former, from which the book draws its title.</p>
