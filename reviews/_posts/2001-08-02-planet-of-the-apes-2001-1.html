  <p>Colossally bad. The only redeeming thing about this movie is the score. Danny Elfman really captures the spirit of the apes with his pounding drums and surreal sounds. Unfortunately the music can do little to salvage the monkey-like performance of Marky Mark or the decreasingly believable and increasingly ridiculous plot twists that plague the film after the first fifteen minutes.</p>
