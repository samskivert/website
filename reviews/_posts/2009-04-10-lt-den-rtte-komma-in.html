<p>Super creepy Swedish vampire movie. Perhaps it was because of the low budget, but the restraint exercised in the special effects department lent it an air of disturbing realism. Two things we learned about the Swedes: they look ridiculous with their sweaters tucked in and the boredom of long winters seems to drive them to mindless violence.</p>
