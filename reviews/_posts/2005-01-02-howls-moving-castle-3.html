  <p>Another gorgeous Miyazaki film. I saw this one in its native Japanese, so though I understood half of the dialogue, it was the unimportant half. None the less, the story was not hard to follow and the view was spectacular. Miyazaki dreams up extraordinary worlds populated with extraordinary characters, to say nothing of their houses.</p>
