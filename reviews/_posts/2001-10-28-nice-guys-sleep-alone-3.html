  <p>It&#8217;s a clear application of the &#8220;boy meets girl, complications arise, time passes, both parties see through complications and everything works out&#8221; formula which I normally avoid, but I had ulterior motives for seeing this film and having done so, I found it to be entertainment of exceptional quality. If you&#8217;re looking for a date film or if this sort of thing is your bag, you won&#8217;t be disappointed.</p>
