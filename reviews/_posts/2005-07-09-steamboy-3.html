  <p>The film contains a stunning combination of modeled machinery, painted backdrops and good old fashioned anime characters. The plot on the other hand was more appropriate for a comic book, not surprising given that it&#8217;s an animated film, but a bit of a disappointment coming from one of the directors that has demonstrated an ability to rise to the task of creating animation that stands toe to toe with its live action brethren.</p>
