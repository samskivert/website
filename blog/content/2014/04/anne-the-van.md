After fourteen long and glorious years of driver automobile partnership, Anne the Van and I are
parting ways. Natalie has finally decided that it might be useful to drive, but she's not ready to
drive something as majestic as Anne, so we're getting a smaller car.

Before turning her loose on the open market, I am putting out feelers to see if anyone "in the
family" is in the market for the Fahrvergn√ºgen experience.

Vital stats are as follows:

  * Make: Volkswagen
  * Model: Eurovan MV
  * Year: 2000
  * Engine: 2.8L V6
  * Mileage: 46,300

That mileage is not in error. I don't drive much, so Anne is as spry and young as a car half her
age (even though there are no Eurovans half her age because VW [stopped making them in 2003]). She
has also had all her immunizations and regular checkups.

Due to a combination of Eurovans being awesome and VW having stopped making them in 2003, they have
retained their value quite well. Vans with triple the mileage of Anne regularly go for $12,000 -
$15,000 on the open market. It would make me happy if Anne went to someone I know, so I'm willing
to part with her for $8,000 to help that happen.

One caveat is that we don't get our [new car] until early June, and I'd like to keep her until
then, so as not to be carless in the event that one of my offspring decides to gravely injure
themselves and require hasty transport to a medical facility.
