<p>Wow, this film was intense. Itâ€™s a rare thing to see a film about the realities of abortion, let alone one set in an oppressive communist society where it has been criminalized in an attempt to raise the birth rate. The portrayal of 1980s Romania was fascinating. It gave the film a gritty matter of factness that strangely amplified both the sense of danger and the feeling of mundanity.
