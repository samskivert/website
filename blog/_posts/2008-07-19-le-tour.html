<p>The Tour de France happened to be passing about 5km from where Iâ€™m staying (near Les Baux des Provence), so naturally a viewing was in order. The first group came and went in the span of about two seconds:</p>

<p>Then maybe half a minute later the second, much larger, group whizzed by. They were a bit more spread out, turning to single file after this short red clump at the head:</p>

<p>Zoom zip! We could feel the whoosh of the giant wind tunnel as we stood on the side of the road.
