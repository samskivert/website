  <p>A fascinating look at the work and works of Andy Goldsworthy, a British sculptor who is often described as a &#8220;collaborator with nature&#8221;. His uncanny ability to improve upon an already beautiful natural setting with sculpture that is both organic and elegant is captured even more dramatically in motion picture than in Goldsworthy&#8217;s own photography. Because his work is so ephemeral &#8212; delicate sculptures of ice melting as the sun rises over a hill, intricate patchworks of reeds balanced tenuously between branches of a tree &#8212; seeing a piece come to life and then rapidly deteriorate conveys a much more profound sense of the fleeting cycles of life which Goldsworthy often tries to capture in his work.</p>
