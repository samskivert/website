<tt>Who said cloning was a purely biological concept?  Unfortunately,
there aren't any worthy sources of information for Multi-Version
Programming on the Web.  In general, Multi-Version Programming refers to
the separate, independent development of multiple versions of the
same software system.  This has the potential to prevent one bug from
appearing in every copy of a program; of course, each version of
the program may be rife with its own bugs.  This is cloning, in a sense;
cloning from the software <i>specifications</i>, rather than from the
source code. </tt>
