<B>The set-up</B>
<br>
In our last exciting installment, Mike developed a distributed object
framework viable as the basis for a multi-player gaming system. 
Mike then enhanced our lives with a <a href="01.html" target="define"><b>kick-ass</b></a><sup>1</sup> <a href="02.html" target="define"><b>word game</b></a><sup>2</sup> for this system.  It involved
finding words on a grid of letters.  The game's great interface proved so
popular here at go2net that it was banned during 
<a href="03.html" target="define"><b>work hours</b></a><sup>3</sup>.
<p>
But sometimes in the wee hours of the night, the game rages on. While I enjoy
the
game immensely, I rarely win. Alas, I am usually no match for the wily
vocabularies and sheer word-finding skills of Mike and Paul. I have
lost more rounds than I care to remember, and if there is one thing
worse than losing, it is losing to 
<a href="http://www.improving.org/paulp/" target="_blank">Paul</a>. Paul is never a sore
loser, but when he wins, the losers must sit through a series of boasts
and prosaic self-glorifications. He makes it quite satisfying to win.

<B>Mr. Greenwell, in his office, with the perl code.</B>
<br>
I have been<table width=180 align=right>

</table> told I have a criminal mind. You know what they say: "A
criminal
mind is a terrible thing to waste." I have a saying of my own: "No problem
can't be solved by programming." ...or maybe it was Paul who said
that.
Damn his confident eloquence! I'll show him!
<p>
Either way, my plan was simple: create a cheat for the word game.
Initially I conceived of a
giant Rube Goldberg-type device with pulleys, buckets and hamster wheels,
but I finally settled on just
 writing some perl code. Sometimes it does feel
the same, though.
<p>
The problem is simple enough: Search the game board for words. 
To do this I needed a list of words, and an efficient algorithm for locating
which of those words were on a given board. The word list was easily
procured; I just downloaded a nice, big <a href="04.html" target="define"><b>crack dictionary</b></a><sup>4</sup>.
<p>
The algorithm was a different story. I originally planned to start with every
letter on the board and do a depth-first search to find all conceivable
"paths" from that letter. I would check each path more than four letters long
and
see if it constituted a valid word. Then I realized this was a bad idea.
The number of words I would be checking was <a href="06.html" target="define"><b>O(n!)</b></a><sup>6</sup>, where n is the number
of letters on the board, in this case 25. While it might be fun to let
the computer try out each of the 15511210043330985984000000 combinations,
it would not finish in the required three minutes, unless "three minutes" was
redefined
as "work hours."
<p>
A better way would be to examine each<table width=180 align=left>
<tr><td width=10><br></td><td><br><hr size=1><b><tt><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="ARIAL"><I>While it might be fun to let
the computer try out each of the 155112100433<br>30985984000000 combinations,

redefined
as "work hours."</I></FONT></tt><br></b><hr size=1><br></td>
</table> dictionary word in order, 
then check to see if it was on the board. This is has a worst-case of
O(n * m),
where n is the number of words, and m is their average length. 
I came up with the sly optimization
of replacing all occurrences of "qu" in the dictionary words
with "q," and treating the special "qu" cube as though it were just a "q."
This
allowed me to deal with everything as a single character. When a word
matched, I simply needed to replace any instances of "q" with "qu"
upon printing it out.  I coded this up and ran it.
My program worked great, but it seemed a little sluggish; perhaps there
was a way I could further speed it up.
<p>
<B>Face Game you must, for only then Jedi Knight will you truly be.</B>
<br>
A voice in my head echoed solemn advice: "Use the source, dumbass." It was
the disembodied voice of Obi-Paul Kenobi! I quickly scanned Mike's
source for the code that did the word-checking and found it identical
in essence to my own, complete with sly Q-substitution. There had to be
a better way.
<p>
I thought about it, and realized that for every word in the dictionary, I was
scanning the entire board for the first letter, and for each
subsequent letter I was checking each of the <table width=180 align=right>
<tr><td width=10><br></td><td><br><hr size=1><b><tt><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="ARIAL"><I>A voice in my head echoed solemn advice: "Use the source,
dumbass."</I></FONT></tt><br></b><hr size=1><br></td>
</table>eight adjacent positions for
possible paths. This is especially wasteful if the word I am
checking begins with a letter absent from the board, as I
am doing 25 comparisons before throwing the word away.
<p>
So I created a hash indexed by letter. The data stored in the hash is a list of
positions on the board where that letter occurs. Much better! Now if a word
has a character that isn't on the board, I know it as soon as I get
to that character and look it up in the hash, only to find it missing.
I arranged it so that each subsequent character is looked up by retrieving its
list of
positions, then making sure those positions are next to the last-picked
cube on the board. Most of the rest of the code remained the same. 
<p>
<B>The Showcase Showdown</B>
<br>
This was it. This was the blazing algorithm I was searching for. I was now
ready to go <i>mano y machino</i> with Paul. I made a few
test runs and achieved rounds in excess of 400 points. Paul had
no hope. Coyly, I asked if he was ready to play a little word
game...
<p>
It didn't take Paul long to find me out. Perhaps it was the way I got up for a
drink of water about a minute into the round, or the way I calmly submitted my
278
points worth of words. He was amused. But now when we play, he logs into my
machine so he can monitor running processes and make sure I'm not cheating.
<p>
If only I hadn't gone for the water ...
