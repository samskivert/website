title: "Integration of Typed and Untyped Code in Thorn – Wrigstad, et al."
category: papers
---

<p>I already reviewed the other Thorn paper, <cite><a href="http://samskivert.com/2010/01/thorn%E2%80%94robust-concurrent-extensible-scripting-on-the-jvm-vitek-et-al/">Thorn—Robust, Concurrent, Extensible Scripting on the JVM</a></cite>. This one just goes into more detail on the type system, and how like-types interact with dynamic and static types. I like the idea of minimizing the impact of converting part of your code to being type checked, as a step toward making your whole program statically typed.</p>
