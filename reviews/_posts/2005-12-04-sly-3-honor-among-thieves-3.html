	<p>Another solid addition to the Sly Cooper line. Numerous entertaining mini-games, lots of leaping raccoon action, amusing story and dialogue. The 3D glasses are a silly gimmick, but fortunately you can not use them. I was impressed that they managed to squeeze in an homage to both Sid Meierâ€™s Pirates and Monkey Island in their pirate episode. Arr!
