  <p>A solid, addictive puzzle game. The adventure mode, which pits you against computer players of increasing difficulty, kept me entertained for weeks on end. By the time I finally finished the second adventure mode without dying and opened up Metal Mario, I was definitely ready to move on to a new game. I imagine that it still holds some promise with sweet four player action, but we haven&#8217;t been doing a lot of multiplayer video gaming lately, opting instead for the board games. I&#8217;ll certainly keep Dr. Mario on the shelf, however, in case a contender does come along some day.</p>
