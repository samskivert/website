  <p>The notion of getting on a train outside my house and continuing to switch lines until reaching the end of the line in southern South America is one that I find very appealing, given my love of trains. Moreover, Theroux is a traveler after my own heart, keeping his eyes open and his mouth shut and poking around in the places most people aren&#8217;t interested in visiting when they&#8217;re away from home. It was also interesting to get a small snapshot of various Central and South American countries from the seventies.</p>
