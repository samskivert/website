  <p>For all the complaints I&#8217;ve heard about bad acting and uninspired plot, I can&#8217;t deny thoroughly enjoying this and the previous Potter film. It&#8217;s good clean fun and I&#8217;m fortunately able to remain uncritical of it as a work of art and just enjoy it as entertainment. Magical.</p>
