  <p>An excellent investigation of the trials and tribulations involved in a variety of non-traditional relationship structures. Easton and Liszt present many of the common difficulties encountered in such circumstances and suggest practical approaches to compromise. A fine read for anyone interested in stepping outside the bounds of traditional monogamous relationships, or for those who find themselves outside those bounds already and in need of some helpful advice.</p>
