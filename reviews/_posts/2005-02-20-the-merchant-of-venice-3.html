  <p>Who knew that Al Pacino would make such a fantastic 16th century money-lender? Shakespeare for me, can be difficult to map into a modern world view, with the result being that I can&#8217;t get my mind around the motivation of his characters. However, this excellent rendition, abetted perhaps by its more timeless tale, delivered Shakespeare&#8217;s message like an apple falling through four hundred years to hit me squarely on the head.</p>
