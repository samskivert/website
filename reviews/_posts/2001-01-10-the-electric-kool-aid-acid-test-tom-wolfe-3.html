  <p>TEKAAT describes the spread of the LSD experience in the early sixties through a chronicle of Ken Kesey and his band of Merry Pranksters. A group that was right at the center of it and going like hell. His writing style goes a long way to capture the essence of the experience, at least as much as I can tell by extrapolating from my own drug experiences. The ideas put forth by Kesey also came along at the right time and helped to bring together some things that had been brewing a while in my own head.</p>
