  <p>I was recently struck by a desire to read everything Mark Twain has ever written. It&#8217;s a good thing he&#8217;s dead because he was pretty damned prolific when it came to putting the pen to the page and publishing the results. Regardless, I&#8217;m already happy with the decision as this was a great story that wildly deviated from my expectation of the sort of things I&#8217;d discover in his bibliography.</p>
