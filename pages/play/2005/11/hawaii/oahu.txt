image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/12/img_0968.jpg I decided to splurge and get a place with a nice view in Waikiki. Here we have one end of Waikiki beach.

image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/14/img_0979.jpg From the opposite side, one could see the rest of Waikiki beach and the famous Diamond Head crater. You have to see an aerial view to really grasp the whole crater aspect of things, however.

image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/13/img_0975.jpg I went shopping for some flip flops in the handily labeled International Market Place.
image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/13/img_0976.jpg I admired the architecture.
image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/13/img_0977.jpg I marveled at the preponderance of palm trees poking out from every nook and cranny.

image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/14/img_0985.jpg Eventually we got on with the wedding business. Here Dad escorts Candace, the blushing bride, up the aisle.

image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/14/img_0989.jpg Later at the reception, there was cake cutting and all the proper activities.

image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/14/img_0991.jpg On the way home, I decided that I couldn't let my fabulous bow tie go unphotographed.
image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/15/img_0994.jpg The next morning at the crack of moonset, I drug myself out of bed intent on hiking to the top of Diamond Head.

image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/15/img_0997.jpg Sunrise from the top of Diamond Head wasn't quite as exciting as moonset from my balcony, but I did enjoy the exercise.

image ../../../../media/photography/2005/11/15/img_1000.jpg Here we can see that Waikiki is rather densely populated, compared to your average tropical paradise.
