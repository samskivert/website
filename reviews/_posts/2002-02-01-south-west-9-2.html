  <p>The film was well crafted and the hapless tripper was good for more than a few laughs, but in the final analysis, only one out of a cast of ten or so characters was at all likeable. Being a film that focused so closely on its characters, it left one not giving much of a damn what happens in the end. That said, I did enjoy the movie, but I&#8217;m a sucker for silly jokes and thumping party scenes.</p>
