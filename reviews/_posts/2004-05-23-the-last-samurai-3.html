  <p>Another better than expected movie watching experience. Sure, the samurai were just as corrupt and oppressive a bunch of bastards as the Japanese government and, aside from select individuals, embodied the ways of life associated with that group about as much as the founding fathers of the U.S. did the noble principles upon which our great country was founded. However, if you were going to set about to romanticizing the samurai, you could do worse than this film.</p>
