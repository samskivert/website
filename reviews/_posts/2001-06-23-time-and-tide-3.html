  <p>If <cite>Time and Tide</cite> were simply a Hong Kong-style action flic, it would hold its own. Fortunately for we viewers, it manages a sense of humor and special effects enough to put fear into the hearts of the purveyors of all the Matrix rip-offs coming out of Hollywood. The action is non-stop, the cinematography is dizzying and the lack of pretense so expertly maintained that when a scenario straight out of Rambo pops up, complete with the police chief handing a gun to the bad guy he just caught, turning him loose to get the <em>really</em> bad guy and saying &#8220;The law doesn&#8217;t account for some situations&#8221;, instead of rolling your eyes in disgust, you&#8217;ll be laughing right along with the director at how perfectly it fits into the film. The manic cutting makes the plot a challenge to follow, but if you relax and absorb, enough is revealed to leave you feeling like you didn&#8217;t miss anything. On par or better than John Woo and a lot more fun.</p>
