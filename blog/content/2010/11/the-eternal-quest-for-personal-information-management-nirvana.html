title: "The eternal quest for personal information management nirvanaz"

<p>I have progressed through a broad variety of personal information management tools over the course of my life, and they invariably fail to meet my needs in one way or another. This periodically motivates a flurry of note taking on what would comprise the “perfect” personal information management system, which I generally record using whatever duct tape and baling wire contraption I am currently using to keep track of things, and then promptly forget about.</p>
<p>About half a decade ago, I wrote a <a href="http://samskivert.com/code/jikan">standalone application</a> that handled the parts of PIM that were done <em>wrongly</em>, in my opinion, by other tools (keeping lists of tasks to do, a journal of daily doings, and seeing at a glance what events were upcoming and recently past). It kept the urges to write a more comprehensive system at bay, and I got by with my tool, a haphazard collection of wikis and text files, and Google calendar.</p>
<p>My entry into the world of computer science research last year triggered a dramatic increase in my generation of notes and ideas that needed keeping track of, not to mention a much more finely divided schedule. To meet my increased PIM needs, I tried <a href="http://code.google.com/p/w2wiki/">minimalist solutions</a>, <a href="http://twiki.org/">maximalist solutions</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/">Googly solutions</a> (among <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">a</a> <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">dozen</a> <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">others</a><a href="http://www.google.com/notebook/">.</a><a href="http://backpackit.com/">.</a><a href="http://projects.gnome.org/tomboy/">.</a>). Each rewarded my substantial organizational efforts with eventual dissatisfaction and malaise. My resolve eventually eroded and I succumbed to my perennial urge to write my own all-singing, all-dancing, wiki/todo/calendar/datastore/dwim application.</p>
<p>I thus present <a href="http://sparecortex.com">Spare Cortex</a>, an unabashed indulgence in my own personal information management needs. To atone for the sin of polluting the world with yet another wiki, I have strived to make it usable by people other than its author. I have provided a <a href="http://sparecortex.com/c/demo">demonstration of its basic functionality</a> to help interested parties determine whether it is worth the time investment of trying out.</p>
<p>My motivations in creating the system (which you may compare to your own PIM motivations to gauge your interest) were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>It should not extravagantly waste a quarter or more of its screen real estate on headers, banners, navigation links and other wikijunk (to paraphrase <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartjunk">Tufte</a>).</li>
<li>It should be hierarchical. The flat namespace of most wiki systems breaks down once you add half a dozen projects each with a dozen pages of content. Prefixing the name of every page with the name of its parents scales poorly. </li>
<li>It should support structured content (most importantly checklists, and what I call “pages”) natively. Configuring half a dozen poorly implemented and unmaintained plugins is a punishment I’d rather avoid.</li>
<li>With regard to checklists, having to open the wiki editor and scroll down through a sea of text to find a todo item to check off (or edit, or move up or down in priority) is painful.</li>
<li>With regard to pages, any project that does not die an early death will eventually accumulate sort of “dashboard” at its top-level, containing outstanding todo items, lists of useful resources, and the top-level links to the copious notes that you’ve taken as the project evolves. Basic page layout capabilities enable one to organize this dashboard page in a way that allows easy viewing of what’s going on with the project and easy updating of ephemeral data.</li>
<li>Furthermore, I don’t want that data landlocked amidst semi-structured text. I should be able to see all of the tasks across all of my projects, or tag individual tasks and place a view of tasks with e.g. the <em>today</em> tag on my top-level “life dashboard” page, alongside my appointments and journal (note: the tagging feature is not yet complete, but is soon forthcoming).</li>
<li>Parts of pages, like checklists, should be accessible at individual URLs which are mobile web browser friendly, so that you can readily access any task list while on the go, and quickly add whatever thought popped into your head.</li>
<li>It should support the attachment of media to individual pages, again not constrained by a global namespace.</li>
<li>It should be searchable (not yet implemented) and support bulk import and export (also not yet implemented).</li>
<li>It should support access controls to enable sharing subtrees (or an entire tree) in a read-only or read-write manner with other people, or with the anonymous public (partly implemented).</li>
</ul>
<p>The system is implemented on Google’s AppEngine, which I confess to having mixed feelings about. Its reliability has been less than stellar during the course of development, though it seems to be improving lately. Further rants on that subject should occupy their own blog post. Should you make use of Spare Cortex for your own information management needs, you can rest comfortably in the knowledge that I’m highly motivated to keep it running smoothly, owing to my own repeated daily use.</p>
<p>If you’ve managed to read this far and are not simply in shock at this display of raw enthusiasm for something of such little consequence, please <a href="http://www.sparecortex.com/">give Spare Cortex a whirl</a>.</p>
