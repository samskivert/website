  <p>A tour de force, debunking a theory to which I didn&#8217;t happen to subscribe myself, but which I was more than willing to hold up so that Diamond could so eloquently knock it down. I&#8217;m reminded of Roger Penrose&#8217;s book, <cite>The Emperor&#8217;s New Mind</cite> where, in the course of making an argument about artificial intelligence, he expertly summarizes the whole of the field of physics. Diamond presents clearly a great deal of information that is fascinating to learn whether or not you care about why the Europeans have managed to take over so much of the world.</p>
