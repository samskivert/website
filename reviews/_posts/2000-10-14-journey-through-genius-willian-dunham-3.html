  <p>I like mathematics. In more recent years, I&#8217;ve come to like histories and biographies as well. This book combines the three in a way that avoids the dullery into which most mathematical, historical and biographical texts tend to sink. At the same time, it&#8217;s not overly dramatic. The author has chosen inherently exciting topics, no small feat given the subject matter, and concerns himself only with presenting them clearly and accurately.</p>
