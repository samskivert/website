The first computer with enhanced musical capabilities was the Amiga, a
<a
href="01.html" target="define"><b>lesser known</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">1</font></sup> system introduced in 1985. It had four digital channels
of audio and a bonus co-processor to feed them. These advanced audio
abilities did not go unnoticed by the many young programmers that owned
them, and quickly a standard emerged for musical playback: the
"Soundtracker Module", or MOD. The MOD is simply an audio format designed
to take advantage of this four-channel setup. 

<P>The MOD format approaches music differently than you may be accustomed to,
even if you know your computer sounds formats. Two other popular sounds
formats that exist on computers are samples and <a
href="02.html" target="define"><b>MIDIs</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">2</font></sup>. By samples, I
mean the general category of straight recordings of some sound. Often
files have extensions like <tt>.wav</tt>, <tt>.au</tt>, and <tt>.aiff</tt>. Since a sample is merely
a recording of a sound, it can be arbitrarily complex, but will often be
very large. A typical three minute song would be several megabytes.  Most
newer music formats that a web user would be familiar with, including real
audio and mpeg audio, are "sample" type sounds. 

<P>A MIDI is much more compact because it doesn't encode the actual sounds,
but rather information on when to play a certain instrument. MIDI was
developed for computer interaction with a device that knows how to make its
own sound, most often a digital keyboard.  A midi file says "play these
notes on a piano, and these other notes on a trumpet." A MOD file most
closely resembles a MIDI, with the addition of the samples, which are the
instruments.  A MOD file says "play these notes and use the recording of
my dog as the instrument." Mods are usually much shorter than a similar
piece of music recorded as a sample. 

<P>Each sample can be played back at a variety of frequencies to generate
different notes on any of the four channels. A simple MOD might consist of
a few drum samples and a piano. Then, perhaps two channels are used to lay
down the drums and the other two channels for the piano sounds. In
addition to playing different notes, the playing of a sample could be
tweaked by select effects such as <a
href="03.html" target="define"><b>arpeggio and vibrato</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">3</font></sup>. 

<P>Each channel has an associated 'track' which is merely a time sequence for
what sample to play and how. Each track is assigned one of the digital
channels for a total of four tracks. These are then organized into
patterns, which have 64 rows of time steps in which to position notes. It
looks something like a high-tech player piano roll. The mod player just
looks at the first row, and simultaneously plays the samples (up to four) 
contained there. Then it waits a set amount of time and plays the samples
on the next row. The patterns are played in the specified order to create
the whole song. 

<P>This allowed for surprising freedom of composition, and MODs became hugely
successful, with many trackers and players popping up. Even today, with
<a
href="04.html" target="define"><b>Amigas no longer in production</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">4</font></sup>, the MOD lives on. After DOS computers
become aurally enhanced by the introduction of such sound cards as the
Sound Blaster, people familiar with MODs <a
href="05.html" target="define"><b>ported the players to DOS</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">5</font></sup>. 
More players and trackers appeared, and soon just as many MODs were being
authored on DOS machines as on Amigas. 

<P>But on the DOS machines, the situation under the hood was quite different.
The Amiga had four digital channels for outputting the sounds, but the
newfangled Sound Blaster had only one.  Fortunately, it is a fairly easy
operation to mix waveforms.  Each bit of each sample is added together,
and the result is divided by four. It is simple wave interaction, with
peaks cancelling troughs. The Amiga wasn't fast enough to mix samples this
way, but the PC was, with the only disadvantage being a slight degradation
of sound quality. 

<P>It didn't take long for the <a
href="06.html" target="define"><b>PC folk</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">6</font></sup> to ask themselves, "We can mix
four sounds, why not eight?" The MOD file format was extended to
accommodate MODs of eight channels. Pretty soon people got even fancier
and added capabilites for up to thirty-two channels, as well as a wide
array of new effects. These are enough removed from the original format to
merit a new filename extension like <tt>.s3m</tt> or <tt>.xm</tt>, but there are essentially
still based on MOD. 

<P>When I was first learning Java, I wanted to create a MOD player applet.
However, I soon discovered that Java had only a very primitive and
high-level sound support.  Playback of sampled sounds is the only thing
supported.  A cool feature it did have is that you merely need to play
back whatever samples you want, and the mixing of all currently playing
samples is done automatically.  That would certainly be a help if there
was a way to play back the sounds at different frequencies. 

<P>It currently looks hopeless, as sound playback is only possible with
<tt>java.applet.AudioClip</tt>, an opaque object that looks suspiciously like it
was added to the language at the <a
href="07.html" target="define"><b>last minute</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">7</font></sup>.  A few people have
written applets that play music in a very MOD-like fashion, but they
download a different sample for each note, which destroys most of the
coolness (and compactness) of MODs. 

<P>Recently, while tooling around with some of the private Sun classes to see
how it all works, I realized it would be possible to create my own
AudioClips with resampled versions of audio data.  After some
experimentation I came up with a sample that could be played at twice the
speed! My code is not entirely up to spec: it relies on some Sun classes
that are not a part of the standard JDK.  They are usually behind the
scenes for audio playback, but are present in all the Java supporting
browsers that I know of.  The classes work, but a serious applet or
application should not depend on them. 

<P>MOD players are completely viable to program in Java. There is, however, a question
of quality of the sound playback.  Here, I have implemented a simple
pattern player. I download the sample and resample it across a range of
notes, and construct AudioClips for each of these notes.  After this, all
the hard work is done, and I just have to play back the right samples at
the right times. 

<P>A bonus feature is the ability to draw upon a high quality source sample
in creating my samples.  Java only supports the playback of 8000 Hz
samples, which as audio enthusiasts know is a very poor sound quality,
about that used in the digital answering machines.  The player I wrote can
use a higher quality sample to construct the samples it needs for the
music, resulting in better sound in the lower frequency samples. 

<P>I have coded up a simple tracker for you to use. Do some experimenting by
creating your own small "song."<P>

Oh no! You don't seem to have Java support! You can't see the cool

<B>Instructions:</b>
<blockquote>
Since most of you aren't musicians anyway, I have provided
a fun set of whimsical "instruments."
Select an instrument and then click on the piano to test the note. Place the
notes in the pattern by clicking on the cell of your choice. You can clear
a cell by selecting the "clear sample" instrument. The speed setting is the
number of milliseconds to wait between each row.<P>
</blockquote><P>

<P>A complete java MOD player is a possibility save for effects,
and if I have enough free
time I would like to finish it.  Certainly being "ported" to the Web will
extend its life for years to come. From its humble beginnings on an
alternative computer, the MOD has come a long way, yet has changed
relatively little.  Many of the original songs composed by young Amiga
hackers are still quite enjoyable, and I recommend
