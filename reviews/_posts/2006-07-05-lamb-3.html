<p>A slapstick narrative on the life of Jesus (nee Joshua) through childhood and adolescece up to the part that everybody’s already heard about, as told by Jesus’s childhood friend Biff. Of course the author just made a bunch of shit up, taking generous liberties with history where it served his purposes, but not aiming to annoy Christians the world wide, more just imagining what life might have been like for the son of God. Biff did get a little annoying at times.
