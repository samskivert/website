  <p>Who knew that a Russian play would work so well set in the slums of Edo? The characters are outstanding  and are exceptionally well portrayed by Kurosawa&#8217;s standard crew. It also occupies a comfortable spot between film and theater, using the confines of the tenement to keep the focus on the characters and their interaction but without making one feel that the camera is trapped in a run down flophouse for two hours.</p>
