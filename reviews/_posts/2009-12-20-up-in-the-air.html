<p>Clooneyâ€™s having a great 2009, what with <cite>Fantastic Mr. Fox</cite> and <cite>The Men Who Stare at Goats</cite> and now <cite>Up in the Air</cite>. I had steeled myself for a romantic comedy, but was pleasantly surprised to get a film that was equal parts thoughtful and hilarious, with a healthy dose of moral ambiguity and lack of obvious feel-good message. Shocking.</p>
