  <p>A tragedy of Shakespearean proportions. Just when the Germans thought they had a lock on atrocity, the Chinese rolled up with the Cultural Revolution and gave them a solid run for their money. I couldn&#8217;t help but be giddily excited whenever they showed people practicing or performing acrobatics, but I assure you the film has copious merit entirely separate from this peculiar interest of mine.</p>
