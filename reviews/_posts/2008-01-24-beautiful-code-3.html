<p>Thirty three essays by thirty three authors describing code they consider to be beautiful. A few were inane, a few were exceptional and the majority were generally good. Iâ€™ve long wanted to start a blog or magazine that consisted solely of engineers describing interesting complex systems they developed or encountered in the real world. Many of these essays fit that criterion and were, as I suspected, very interesting for that reason alone.
