<p>Part of the joy of being a grad student involves reading countless academic papers and in many cases generating summaries and commentary. This is done for one’s own comprehension and memory or as part of a fun game one plays with one’s instructor where they require summaries to ensure that you’ve read the papers in time to participate in their discussion.</p>
<p>I’m chiefly interested in the former benefit, and because it may be of some marginal interest to the small group of readers of this blog, I’ve decided to post those summaries and commentary here. Hopefully my naive initial forays into commentary and analysis will grow, in the fullness of time, into brilliant snapshots that reach right into the heart of each paper and highlight the intellectual core of the work, its impact and its potential. One likes to have goals.</p>
