  <p>I like the concept: you&#8217;re a kid living in the future playing this hugely popular MMP which, of course, involves advanced technology like a fully immersive neural interface and fully expressive characters. Something goes awry and a bug or virus in the game causes your friend to go into a coma. You, fearless or stupid, continue playing to try to further understand what happened to your friend and, in the process, become a critical element in some greater, unfolding drama. The graphics were good enough to keep me entertained, but a few fatal flaws left me without the resolve to continue playing.
<p> Foremost is that you can only save when you&#8217;re in town, which 	means that if you spend two hours getting to the bottom of a long 	and marginally entertaining dungeon only to die fighting the boss 	at the bottom, you have to do the whole damned thing over again 	and any levels you gained or items you found along the way are 	entirely lost. </p>
<p> Second, I found the party battle mechanics to be clumsy and 	annoying. I spend most of my time fiddling around trying to get my 	weaker mage character not to go wandering up next to the monsters 	where he&#8217;d get the crap beat out of him and essentially 	micro-managing my group of three characters. Fighting by myself 	was much more satisfying and fluid, but is not a viable option for 	the harder dungeons. </p>
<p> Finally, I really don&#8217;t like the notion of leveling up and being 	limited not by my own skill, but by the amount of time I&#8217;ve spent 	wandering around whacking monsters and finding more powerful 	items. While apparently other RPGs make you do even more of this, 	my tolerance for such tedium is low, especially when I don&#8217;t find 	the basic battle mechanic to be altogether that fun. </p>
