  <p>A worthy successor to Edwin Abbot&#8217;s tale of Albert line in <cite>Flatland</cite>, Stewart covers a great deal more ground (and space) in telling the story of Albert&#8217;s great great granddaughter, Victoria Line. His mathematical meanderings are clothed in just enough narrative to preserve continuity and the wordplay, if not always brilliant, is darned good for a mathematician. For his finale, he veers off into the realm of the physical, giving a very readable overview of relativity, quantum mechanics, supersymmetry and string theory. It&#8217;s a pleasurable romp through the fields of mathematics and far and away easier to read than any other treatment of the same subject matter.</p>
