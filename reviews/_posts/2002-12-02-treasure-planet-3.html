  <p>Thanks to the magic of low expectations, I enjoyed this film quite a lot. The art style was fantastic and it showcased the skill of Disney&#8217;s animators. The plot didn&#8217;t stray too far from that of the source material and, mercifully enough, the eXtreme sports elements were kept to a minimum. I especially appreciated the extent to which they further developed the father-son relationship between Silver and Jim.</p>
