  <p>With such a snappy title, it&#8217;s no wonder the book was so popular. The advice was all rock solid, even if he did repeat himself a bit to really drive the points home. I read an edition published in 1950, as I heard that modern editions have been heavily edited from the 1936 original aiming to smooth over its lack of political correctness. There is some great straight shooting advice in this edition, like &#8220;Don&#8217;t nag&#8221; aimed at the housewives and &#8220;Don&#8217;t compare your wife&#8217;s cooking to your mother&#8217;s&#8221; aimed at the husbands. Words to live by.</p>
