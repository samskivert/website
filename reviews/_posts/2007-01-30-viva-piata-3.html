<p>I loved this game! I bred every last piñata and tracked down every last achievement. Who knew it could be so much fun to tend a garden, breed piñatas, fend off pests and fiddle with the landscape? I had figured Rare for dead, but VP is a clear sign that some good people have stuck around and convinced their bosses at Microsoft to let them make crazy games. Bravo!
