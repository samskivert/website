  <p>As is common among journalists and psychologists, Gladwell pursues slippery subjects that resist quantification, coupled with numerous anecdotes and a rich supply of generalization. Regardless, his ideas appeal strongly to the intuition, despite their basically non-intuitive nature. We are presented with an excellent framework for recognizing tipping points in retrospect, but creating them shall remain a nebulous art. I did enjoy the numerous interesting results from psychology that he tied together in the course of his arguments.</p>
