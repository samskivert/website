  <p>Hot mutant action! It warms my cockles to bear witness to a big budget film gone so right. Somehow they managed not to lose sight of the plot and characters in the orgy of special effects and action. Working with the bolder strokes of a comic book story must have helped, but numerous others have managed to fail miserably with the same raw material, <cite>Daredevil</cite> being a prime recent example.</p>
