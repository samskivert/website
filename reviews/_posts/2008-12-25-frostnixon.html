<p>Sometimes fluffy, but builds to a powerful climax. I had especial appreciation for the emotional performance of the actors. That’s been a recent focus for me and to see these guys faking it so well was humbling. I was left feeling pity for Nixon and wanted him to find some salvation. Maybe I’ll be able to muster that same goodwill for GW in the fullness of time. <cite>W</cite> had its moments, but never felt like a serious portrayal. Even more tangentially, the theaters are extremely crowded on Christmas day. This aspect of the tradition is new to me.</p>
