<p>Osamu Tezuka’s character design kind of creeps me out. The beady eyes and the giant Popeye legs are very disturbing when plopped down in the middle of an immaculately rendered Art Deco dystopia. In spite of that, the visual experience was incredible and the film dipped into anime cliché with merciful infrequence.</p>
