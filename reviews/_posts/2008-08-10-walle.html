<p><cite>Wall-E</cite> had a slightly different feel from previous Pixar films. A bit more dystopian and contemplative. They accomplished a lot with very little dialog which gave the first half of the film a nice air of mystery. The second half was a bit more on formula, but still excellent all around. Score another one for Pixar.
