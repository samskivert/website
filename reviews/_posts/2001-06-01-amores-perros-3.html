  <p>Three movies for the price of one! Fortunately, all of them are pretty good. Not knowing that the title translates to &#8220;Love&#8217;s A Bitch&#8221;, I was a bit confused by the big, fat notice at the beginning of the film that no dogs were hurt during its creation. By the end, I was of the opinion that the warning could perhaps have been a bit bigger &#8212; and blinking. Like any properly edgy film, it evoked a lot of stomach clenching as the grizly subject matter unfolded.</p>
