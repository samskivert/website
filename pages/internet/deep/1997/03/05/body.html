<img src="bonk.gif" align=left width=139 height=106 alt="[bonk! image]">The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the software silk used to
spin the World Wide Web. Unfortunately, modern browsers traverse our
Web with the swiftness of flies trapped in Charlotte's.  Sadly, an
elegant design often leads to poor performance.  A tasteful protocol
like HTTP often experiences growing pains; new features could encumber
the Web's original architectural grace.  Before the New Web is ready
for public consumption, though, important extensions must be added for
secure transactions and better performance. The Web has  been evolving
rapidly and HTTP must adapt to support the Web's success.

<P>HTTP was originally designed by physicist Tim Berners-Lee in 1989.
Working at CERN, the European center for nuclear research, he needed to
share reports and blueprints with collaborating physicists in other
countries. The Internet was the solution to his problem; they just
needed a new tool to locate documents and navigate through their work.
Early browsers hid confusing Web idioms, such as URLs and HTML,
allowing users to <a
href="01.html" target="define"><b>work in peace</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">1</font></sup>.

<P>HTTP is a simple transport protocol for fetching files from remote
machines.  A client sends an HTTP request specifying a single method
to an HTTP server.  The most common methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
The GET method sends a request for a single file, such as an HTML page
or an inline GIF graphic. The server returns the file with a <a
href="02.html" target="define"><b>MIME</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">2</font></sup>
header identifying the type of file.  POST is typically used by HTML
forms to send data to a back-end CGI script.  The PUT and DELETE methods
are subject to the server's discretion.  Most servers would rather not
have anonymous users modifying the server's files.  (Just ask the CIA!)
<a
href="03.html"><b>Have some fun with your new knowledge!</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">3</font></sup>

<P>Unfortunately, HTTP interacts poorly with TCP, the underlying transport
protocol. HTTP is a "clean," stateless protocol and ignorantly creates
a new TCP connection to fetch each file.  Each connection requires
additional handshaking and flow-control between the client and server,
increasing the overall transfer time. Server throughput is also
hindered by each of these TCP connections; extraneous connections block
other clients and increase the amount of state information the server
must remember.

<P>An enhanced version of HTTP could remedy some problems of the original
HTTP design, while maintaining backwards compatibility. The Internet
Engineering Standards Group is considering a draft proposal of
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Protocols/Overview.html" target="_blank">HTTP/1.1</A>, informally known as HTTP-NG.  HTTP/1.1 could enable
you not only to buy your <a
href="04.html" target="define"><b>girlfriend</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">4</font></sup> flowers over the Web with complete
peace of mind, but to do it quickly enough to make up for forgetting
her birthday.

<P>Mutual authentication will allow clients and servers to know with whom
they're sharing privileged information. This information can be encased
within encrypted HTTP messages and passed safely through untrusted
networks.  Software hooks could allow users to plug in new payment
mechanisms, such as DigiCash (or whichever ecash systems become popular.)

<P>Performance is improved by streamlining the handshaking between clients
and servers. Rather than creating a new TCP connection for each file
request, HTTP/1.1 can multiplex a number of "virtual sessions" with a
client over a single TCP connection. Once a server connection has been
established, multiple file requests can be shuttled across the
connection with little delay.

<P>There are two strategies for transitioning from HTTP/1.0 to the proposed
HTTP/1.1. The first is the "dual stack approach". New Web clients could
support both versions of HTTP. When talking with an old HTTP/1.0
server, the client could recognize the new HTTP/1.1 methods have
confused the server. The client would resort to speaking HTTP/1.0 to
retrieve the remaining files from the server. Unfortunately, the dual
stack implementation offers no benefit to old Web clients.

<P>Another transition strategy is to use an HTTP/1.0 proxy server. Old
clients would ask the proxy servers for requested files and then the
proxy server would fetch the files from the real HTTP/1.1 server. A big
advantage of the proxy server approach is that old Web clients could
unknowingly benefit from the performance improvements of HTTP/1.1 Web
servers. Since the proxy server may often be running on the client's
local network, the client can quickly retrieve files from the proxy
server that have already been pre-fetched using HTTP/1.1
optimizations!

<P>Starry-eyed software companies have their own plans for the New Web.
Trying to lug a tired rabbit out of a hat, Sun Microsystems has decided
their Network File System (NFS) should replace HTTP as the language of
the New Web.  NFS, spoken by veteran file servers of the LAN world, has
been retooled for the web: enter <A HREF="http://www.sun.com/sunsoft/solaris/networking/webnfs" target="_blank">WebNFS</A>.

<P>The original NFS was designed for local-area networks, where there is
usually little need for error recovery or flow-control. The Big Bad
Internet, however, requires big-time error recovery and flow-control.
Stop signs may provide adequate flow-control for your residential
neighborhood, but an <a
href="05.html" target="define"><b>interstate highway</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">5</font></sup> must deal with quite a
different set of issues.

<P>WebNFS is plain-vanilla NFS plus a couple easy assumptions. Minimizing
the initial handshaking between clients and servers improves performance
over <a
href="06.html" target="define"><b>high-latency networks</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">6</font></sup>.  A pedantic NFS client negotiates with a
port-mapping service at well-known port 111 to determine the NFS server
port.  Since most NFS servers use port 2049, the lazy WebNFS client might
forgo port negotiation and head there directly.  The client can specify
the full file pathname to a WebNFS server in a single HTTP URL.  Regular
NFS clients must traverse a file path one directory at a time, a killer in
high latency conditions.

<P>Unfortunately, WebNFS is just a transfer layer protocol. As a
lowest common denominator file system, NFS can't support all high-level
features of HTTP.  For example, HTTP uses MIME headers to describe data
files, allowing the browser to interpret each file intelligently. NFS
can only retrieve raw binary files, forcing the browser to guess at the
contents of files by, for example, hoping the filename extensions look
familiar. If you don't mind the games Windows 95 plays with its "long"
filenames, then you might not be bothered by these parlor tricks either.

<P>While marketing departments are dreaming new schemes to "Webbify" their
products, academic researchers are exploring more fundamental issues of
Web expansion. Basic questions, such as how to integrate existing
applications with the Web or how to maintain data coherency across the
Web, are still unanswered. At the University of California at Berkeley,
researchers are studying these problems as part of their
<A HREF="http://now.cs.berkeley.edu/WebOS/" target="_blank">WebOS/WebFS</A> project.

<P>The goal of the WebFS project is to create a file system abstraction
for common Internet services. For example, a prototype WebFS for
Solaris already enables unmodified binaries to reach for files across
the Web.  The global Web namespace becomes part of the local file
system; a kernel module quietly translates references to remote files
into HTTP requests. WebFS clients don't need to know WebFS or HTTP
syntax to access files over the Web, while Sun's WebNFS requires that
clients and servers speak WebNFS. In fact, Berkeley's WebFS could be
extended to support new transport protocols, including Sun's WebNFS.

<P>With the entire Internet as your (and everyone else's) hard drive,
cache coherence becomes a major concern. The WebFS project proposes
using IP multicast to improve file caching and reduce network latency.
Many applications, such as interactive games or stock prices, are only
interested in file updates. Rather than bombarding a server with
multiple requests, clients could ask the server to forward new
information when it's available.  The server doesn't waste time
processing redundant requests. The network routers aren't busy
transmitting old information. The client can just sit back and relax,
knowing it'll receive pertinent updates when they're available.
Everybody's happy!

<P>Unfortunately, IP multicast has some problems. Common browsers, such as
Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, don't support
multicast yet. Also, clients must use a shared multicast address to
receive message updates. The Internet Protocol (IP) has a limited
number of addresses reserved for multicast groups, though the proposed
IPv6 should have more than enough multicast addresses. Assuming
multicast services become popular, network routers could become swamped
as their routing tables grow too big to handle efficiently.

<P>Defining the shape (and brand name!) of the New Web is a prize sought
by many software companies. Netscape is developing Constellation, an
Internet-ready replacement for the user's desktop interface. Microsoft
projects like Nashville and ActiveDesktop will create the illusion of a
<a
href="07.html" target="define"><b>Web-like interface to your local file system</b></a><sup><font
size="-1">7</font></sup>.

<P>Independent Web developers may be left wondering which New Web
technology is the True Grail. Every user has different demands,
though, and the real answer may be "None of the above".  More
likely the answer is "All of the above, sort of..."
