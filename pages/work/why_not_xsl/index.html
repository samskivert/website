<p>I have been preparing for the development of the next generation web
development environment for Go2Net and have been investigating various
standards and initiatives in the industry. A major component of the web
development environment will be the system by which dynamic information
is combined with static information and marked up with HTML. One of the
technologies for performing that function that is receiving a lot of attention
at present is the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/">eXtensible Stylesheet
Language</a> or XSL. XSL covers a wide range of functionality and one part
of it, the part that is presently most applicable to web developers, is
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSL
Transformations</a> or XSLT.
<p>This document assumes a familiarity with XSL and XSLT and the means
by which they would be applied to web application development. If you don't
already have that familiarity, a good way to get it is to read the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/guide.html">users
guide</a> for Cocoon, which is an implementation of XSL/XSLT.
<p>As the title suggests, I have come up with a variety of reasons why
XSL/XSLT will not provide a good foundation for a web development environment.
With some additional technologies, I believe XSL/XSLT might be able to
be made to work, but the question remains whether or not XSL will turn
out to be an improvement over existing strategies or the alternative combination
of XML and CSS. Without further ado, I will describe some of my complaints.
<h4>
XSL syntax is less than comprehensible</h4>
While the general purpose transformation capabilities provided by XSLT
are powerful and allow for some really nifty stuff to be done, we don't
really need 95% of that functionality and we pay a serious price in page
understandability to get it. XSL is a declarative language and a cryptic
looking one to boot. Procedural programming languages are in widespread
use today, while declarative languages like Prolog languish in unpopularity.
This isn't to say that declarative languages are bad or that they don't
provide extraordinary expressive power. But they are also notoriously CPU-intensive,
are easily misused and behave unexpectedly. XSL suffers from all of these
problems.
<p>My preference is for a template system that is simple and comprehensible.
XSL is sufficiently incomprehensible that programmers <i>will</i> mess
up when using it. Non-programmers will be completely at a loss to understand
what is going on during the transformation process.
<h4>
Does not achieve complete separation of code and HTML</h4>
Various systems use various approaches. None of them have proved to be
satisfactory. The systems that I've seen built with XSL use the most unsatisfactory
approach of them all, embedding code into the web page. Alternative approaches
exist, but also have their problems:
<p>JSP + Tag libraries
<ul>
<li>
Requires lots of structured, extra coding to accomplish simple things.</li>
</ul>
JSP controller servlet and JSP view servlet
<ul>
<li>
Prevents integration of formatting and retrieval. You must store information
from, say, a database query into a temporary object for later formatting
by the view servlet instead of formatting on the fly as you fetch each
row from a result set.</li>
</ul>
WebMacro
<ul>
<li>
Almost there but still requires looping constructs in the template files.</li>
</ul>
My preference is for a system similar to our current Pfile system with
some extensions. A Pfile approach with blocks of template text that can
be repeated is much cleaner in the HTML and allows for a complete absence
of code. The servlet author can perform on-the-fly substitutions as the
information becomes available in the normal flow of code. Though the substitutions
remain in memory until the Pfile is flushed to the output stream, the servlet
author does not have to create special classes or use inefficient general
purpose classes to store the information until it is ready to be substituted
into the template.
<h4>
Without client-side rendering, XSL is very expensive</h4>
In the distant future, XSL will be used in a scenario like this:
<p><img SRC="perfect_world.png" height=162 width=522>
<p>But browsers that support XSL are not likely to be in widespread use
for at least another year, more likely two. Even then, we are unlikely
to want to forgo support for older browsers entirely which is what such
a scenario would require.
<p>In the meanwhile, people are architecting systems like so:
<p><img SRC="current_world.png" height=162 width=543>
<p>However, systems of this nature suffer from serious performance issues
because the process of applying XSL templates to XML source data is an
exceptionally expensive one. Since the XML generated by the servlet is
dynamic, most caching cannot be performed because the information changes
from request to request. In reality, neither the markup, nor the structure
generally change from request to request, only the actual data (the information
in between the tags of the source XML document), but this architecture
is such that it cannot take advantage of that characteristic.
<p>I came up with another possible architecture which takes advantage of
the fact that the XML source information rarely changes in structure but
only in content. No existing system (that I could find) uses a structure
like this, but we could build one based on existing XSL batch processing
tools. It looks like so:
<p><img SRC="alternate_world.png" height=162 width=704>
<p>Here we forgo the possibility of generating XML from the servlet in
a way that one would expect, but instead we assume that the XML will end
up looking something like so:
<blockquote><tt>&lt;quote></tt>
<br><tt>&lt;name>Qualcomm, Inc.&lt;/name></tt>
<br><tt>&lt;price>124 3/4&lt;/price></tt>
<br><tt>&lt;change>+3/4&lt;/change></tt>
<br><tt>...</tt>
<br><tt>&lt;/quote></tt></blockquote>
which we can turn into a template like so:
<blockquote><tt>&lt;quote></tt>
<br><tt>&lt;name>&lt;#name#>&lt;/name></tt>
<br><tt>&lt;price>&lt;#price#>&lt;/price></tt>
<br><tt>&lt;change>&lt;#change#>&lt;/change></tt>
<br><tt>...</tt>
<br><tt>&lt;/quote></tt></blockquote>
then mark up the XML template with XSL in a pre-processing phase to generate
an HTML template which contains a formatted quote into which we then substitute
at runtime the actual values for the dynamic tags.
<p>This architecture can immediately be seen to have problems, however.
For example, one thing XSL would be used to do would be to color the change
value either red or green depending on whether or not the quote was an
uptick or a downtick. We don't know this during the pre-processing phase
and therefore can't use XSL to perform that part of the markup. This pushes
the markup logic back into the servlet and in an unclean way that reduces
encapsulation.
<p>The upshot of all of this is that the intended deployment scenario for
XSL is not yet feasible and we are forced to come up with some sort of
interim solution. Using an interim solution based on XSL is definitely
a possibility, but there are other failings of XSL that point to it possibly
not even being a good standard to shoot for in the long term. I refer you
to <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/1999/05/xsl/xslconsidered_1.html">this
article</a> detailing the failings of XSL to perform the service of client-side
formatting of XML data.
<h4>
Summary and recommendations</h4>
Most of my initial negative reactions to the solutions and examples I've
seen using XSL stem from a lack of a good system for getting dynamic information
into the system. The examples in this <a href="http://www.plenix.com/xsp/doc/xsp-primer.html">XSP
Primer</a> demonstrate that lack. Example 3 shows code being embedded into
the source XML file which clearly not viable. Example 4 accomplishes the
same task with tag libraries, requiring a bunch of extra code written in
the cryptic and cumbersome XSL syntax just to perform the simple task of
inserting the current date into the page.
<p>Instead, a system much like our existing Pfiles would much more cleanly
accomplish the task at hand. A servlet would load up a template XML file,
replace a &lt;#date#> tag in that XML file with the current date and pass
the result on to the XSL processor for actual transformation into HTML.
With a system like this, most of my issues with XSL are resolved. Logic
related to fetching and organizing the information on a page can be simply
and clearly expressed in a servlet that substitutes that information into
an XML template file. Logic related to markup (like the decision of whether
or not to color the change value green or red in the markup of a stock
quote described above) can be encapsulated into tag libraries. The addition
of navigation, header and footer markup can be done with the XSL processor
in a reasonably straightforward manner.
<p>The remaining problem is that performing the XSL transformations on
the server may simply be too slow for a system with any meaningful amount
of traffic. Tests should be performed and if the performance is completely
abysmal (which I suspect it will be), we will have to consider other options.
Fortunately, we have identified the major components of the XSL-based system
and we can come up with efficient replacements that preserve the structure
of the system so that when the day comes to transition to browser-based
XSL rendering, we will be prepared. Those major components one last time
for review are:
<ul>
<li>
A template/substitution system to be used by servlets to generate the XML
source data. In most cases the XML source data is really just well formed
HTML with some additional tags where we are passing structured information
like stock quotes on to the formatting engine for layout.</li>

<li>
A system for the definition of formatting components (in the XSL system
this is provided by tag libraries) which encapsulate the formatting of
a particular piece of information (like a stock quote, a mail message or
the summary information for a backgammon game in progress).</li>

<li>
A system for the wrapping of a page's content (produced by formatting the
XML source data) with a header, navigation and footer appropriate to a
particular branded interface.</li>
</ul>
These components can definitely be implemented in a manner less general
purpose than XSL but also far less resource intensive.
