  <p>A fine film for the middle-aged man. I&#8217;m probably indulging in a bit of Schadenfreude as I&#8217;m no doubt happier and more confident in the direction my life is taking than our two unsuspecting protagonists, but I felt a good dose of empathy none the less. I also appreciated the plentiful use of wine-jargon; it felt like a vicarious trip to Napa.</p>
