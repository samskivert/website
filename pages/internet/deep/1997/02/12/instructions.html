<b>Instructions for the Super-Duper GP Critter Simulation</b>

<tr bgcolor="#99cc66"><th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th>

<tr bgcolor="#ccff99"><th>Population Size</th><td>
This parameter controls the number of organisms that will be competing in
a particular generation.</td>

<tr bgcolor="#99cc66"><th>Generations</th><td>
This parameter controls the number of generations for which the simulation
will be run. Remember that the first generation and the last generation
are actually displayed in the view, but the in-between generations are
simulated without a display so that they pass much more quickly.</td>

<tr bgcolor="#ccff99"><th>Mutation Rate</th><td>
When two parents are crossed over, the child is mutated a little bit
before being placed into the next generation. This parameter controls the
percentage of the child's instructions that will be mutated. Values that
are too high going to cause instability in nicely evolved strategies while
values that are too low will cause evolution to take place more slowly.
</td>

<tr bgcolor="#99cc66"><th>Food Density</th><td>
This controls the percentage of cells that contain a food morsel at the
beginning of each generation. In general, lower values are going to evolve
the craftiest organisms because in an abundance of food, even the stupid
ones survive.</td>

<tr bgcolor="#ccff99"><th>Food Energy</th><td>
This controls the amount of energy that a creature receives by eatiing a
food morsel. Execution of each instruction (move forward, turn left or
turn right) costs one food unit. Setting this value too low won't allow
the organisms any time to move around and get another piece of food after
having found the first. Setting it too high will allow the organisms an
extremely long time to wander around after they've eaten a piece of food
or two.</td>
