  <p>Good clean wackiness. One might not appreciate a well-paced drama about a man whose otherwise mundane life is falling apart and embarks on a wacky adventure to try to find some meaning therein, but were one to find out that it involves a woman who periodically fills up with water and has to make wild passionate love to &#8220;release the water&#8221;, then one might be inclined to start whistling a different tune.</p>
