<p>A consistently readable, but only mostly consistently convincing book about rationality and human nature. Some of his arguments stretch a bit thin, but I have to admit that his rational interpretation of the world resonates with my own biases. Even where I feel that he’s over extending, I find myself wanting to believe him. I’ll conveniently ignore the irrationality of this, lest it undermine his thesis and ruin the fun for everyone.</p>
