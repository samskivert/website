  <p>An interesting work in spite of the author&#8217;s lack of pizazz. Having thoroughly failed to achieve a state of flow while reading the author&#8217;s previous work, <cite>Flow</cite>, I was reluctant to pick up another of his volumes. However, the promise of lengthy quotes from the 100-plus creative interviewees gave me hope that Csikszentmihalyi&#8217;s dry prose would be frequently interrupted by amusing anecdotes, and indeed it was. That said, neither he nor they had anything terribly surprising to say.</p>
