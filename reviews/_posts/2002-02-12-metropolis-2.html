  <p>I was unmoved. Though the film had a striking visual style and outstanding art work, it lacked anything resembling an interesting plot or coherent characters. I&#8217;m willing to make concessions for cultural differences, but I was left feeling that this was more like the Japanese equivalent of <cite>Collateral Damage</cite>.</p>
