<p>They created a virtual presence for remote team members in the form of a cart with a computer, monitor and a few webcams strapped onto it. The remote person could fire up a program on their end and “inhabit” the proxy to participate in group or one-on-one meetings, and essentially have a physical presence at the home office. Knowing second-hand that it sucks to be a faraway spoke on a project where most of the team members work face-to-face, I think this is a cool idea.
