  <p>So my friend writes in an email: どうしてかって？ A reasonably innocuous statement, except I&#8217;m not exactly sure which verb かって is. So I consult my trusty dictionary:</p>
<p>   欠く (かく) (v5k) to lack; to break; to crack; to chip; (P);<br />
   書く (かく) (v5k) to write; (P);<br />
   掻く (かく) (v5k) (1) (uk) to scratch; (2) to perspire; (3) to shovel; to paddle; (P);<br />
   描く (かく) (v5k) to draw; to paint; to sketch; to depict; to describe;<br />
   且つ (かつ) (adv,conj) yet; and;<br />
   勝つ (かつ) (v5t) to win; to gain victory; (P);<br />
   刈る (かる) (v5r) to cut (hair); to mow (grass); to harvest; to clip; to shear; to reap; to trim; to prune; (P);<br />
   苅る (かる) (v5r) to mow;<br />
   駆る (かる) (v5r) to drive (car); to spur on; to impel; (P);<br />
   借る (かる) (v5r) to borrow; to have a loan; to hire; to rent; to buy on credit;<br />
   狩る (かる) (v5r) to hunt;<br />
   支う (かう) (v5u) to support or prop up;<br />
   飼う (かう) (v5u) to keep; to raise; to feed; (P);<br />
   買う (かう) (v5u) to buy; (P);<br />
勝手 (かって) (adj-na,n) kitchen; one&#8217;s own convenience; one&#8217;s way; selfishness; (P);<br />
曾て (かって) (adv) (1) once; before; formerly; ever; former; ex-; (2) never (with negative verb); </p>
<p>Keerist! Sure, I should be able to figure out from context which one of the <em>sixteen</em> possibilities is the right one, but I don&#8217;t know if I have the energy to even read through the whole damned list to find out. Next time I&#8217;m learning Spanish!</p>
