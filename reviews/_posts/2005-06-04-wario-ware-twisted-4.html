  <p>Twisted gives us a glimpse of the wacky experimentation we&#8217;ll be able to do when nanotech allows us all to build our own crazy input devices and incorporate them into our games. Rotating the GBA is great fun and the nature of Wario Ware&#8217;s microgames is the perfect place to experiment with ways to turn it into gameplay. Yay for Nintendo, a revolution indeed.</p>
