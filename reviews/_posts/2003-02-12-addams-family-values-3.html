  <p>I was convinced that this movie was going to suck, but it turned out to be a laugh. More Addams antics! I did have the good sense to turn off the DVD player immediately upon seeing the credits so as not to be thrown into another fit of involuntary muscle contractions by whatever coke-fueled abomination M.C. Hammer wrote for the sequel.</p>
