  <p>Anything I might write here will pale in comparison to the glory of this game. It is an epic adventure crafted with the utmost care and skill, a gaming experience that comes together like a magnificent symphony, the whole so much more than the sum of its parts. Not one part of this game was anything less than fantastic and some parts of it were so inspired as to echo in my consciousness for years to come. In the slightly paraphrased words of Mr. Littlejeans, &#8220;Best game ever, man.&#8221;</p>
