  <p>An above-average platformer which blatantly attempts to appeal to teenage boys, resulting in a character interaction and dialogue that can just barely be tolerated long enough to appreciate the interesting array of gadgets that are used to navigate the levels and bosses of the game. When I could manage to get the flashbacks of <cite>Jak and Daxter</cite> out of my head, I mostly enjoyed it.</p>
