<p>Another Kurosawa masterpiece, in this case starring a citizen of my favorite ex-nation Tuva. I have great respect for a filmmaker that is crazy enough to take a huge crew and make a vast, sweeping film in a enormous country, spanning multiple seasons, and still manage to capture the tenderness of the relationship between Dersu and the Captain. Still manage to capture the delicate longing for the untamed wild and the sorrow for its loss shared by those two men. My heart broke when the Captain turned on the snowy hillside to call out “Dersuuu” and was met with the reply “Capitaaan!”
