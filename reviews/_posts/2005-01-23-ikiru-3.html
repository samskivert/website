  <p>The life if a 1950s Japanese bureaucrat is at times painful to watch and the cultural gap makes it really difficult to identify with the main character, but in spite of these sizable obstacles, Kurosawa manages to reach across time and space to open our heart up a bit and allow us to look inside. I also really liked the scenes of free-wheeling debauchery.</p>
