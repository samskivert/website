  <p>A visually stunning film that seemed to make a lot more sense than my hazy recollection of its predecessor, but nonetheless kept both feet firmly planted in the realm of the speculative and vague. I prefer Vinge or Egan&#8217;s more concrete post-human ponderings to this sort of &#8220;Gosh, if we start replacing parts of our bodies with machinery we&#8217;re eventually going to become scary robots&#8221; over-dramatization.</p>
