  <p>I played enough Mario Golf on the N64 to power a small Indian village (what in the hell that analogy means is left as an exercise for the reader). Despite the lack of satisfying 3D visuals and the ever appealing &#8220;Nice Shot!&#8221; sample that accompanies a perfect swing, the GBC version manages to be just as fun as it&#8217;s console cousin. The RPG element is wacky, but works; I like that one builds up their character&#8217;s skills rather than just opening up new characters; I also appreciate that this is one of the few Game Boy games that doesn&#8217;t leave me with cramped up, claw-like hands after playing for hours on end. It makes for a reasonably relaxed twenty minute diversion when one isn&#8217;t in the mood for twitchy puzzling, or dredging up all the necessary working memory to make progress in an RPG.</p>
