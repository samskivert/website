<p>My efforts to post my Euler solutions with commentary remain woefully behind (I just finished problem 110), but when I took action to close this gap, I discovered that I had skipped over problem 66 so long ago. I recall being frustrated after beating my head against it for a while and making no headway.</p>
<p>Filled with renewed vigor, I tackled it again here under the invigorating Mexican sunshine. Alas, the sunshine proved to be of little help. I spent a long time wrangling with the equation in the form <em>y² = (x+1)(x-1)/D</em>. This led me to explore the family of solutions <em>nD + 1</em> and <em>nD – 1</em>, which are very nice, but definitely not minimal.</p>
<p>I then played around with factoring <em>D</em> and trying to come up with some way to efficiently search for potential solutions using those factors, since <em>D</em> has to divide evenly into <em>(x + 1)(x – 1)</em>. But it needn’t do so in any convenient way. For example, for <em>D = 28</em>, the minimal solution is <em>(127 + 1)(127 – 1)/28</em> which factors into <em>2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 × 2 · 3 · 3 · 7 / 7 · 2 · 2</em>. Some of the factors go into the left numerator and some in the right, it’s mayhem.</p>
<p>Eventually I decided to do some Googling and discovered that this is closely related to the well-known <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PellEquation.html">Pell equation</a>. For reasons not entirely clear to me, its solutions lie in the continued fraction expansion of the square root of <em>D</em>.</p>
<p>Implementing the “usual recurrence relations” was pretty straightforward, though a bit of memoization was needed (the unsightliness of that part of the code annoys me, but I am annoyed enough with this problem already that I don’t feel like twiddling it further). <code>BigInt</code> also turned out to be necessary, as the largest “minimal” <em>x</em> is <em>16421658242965910275055840472270471049</em>, which doesn’t quite fit into 64 bits.</p>
