  <p>A really fascinating summary of Pinker&#8217;s work on understanding the machinery of language. He focuses specifically on the case of irregular English verbs, which might not seem at first glance to be a subject deep enough to carry a 300 page book, but turns out to be rich with opportunity for discovery. If you have even an armchair interest in linguistics, I highly recommend this information-packed, easy read.</p>
