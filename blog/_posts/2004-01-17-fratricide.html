He does look pretty happy about the whole business. Perhaps he&#8217;s relieved that he won&#8217;t have to vie for mommy&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>Unrelatedly, it snowed today! I haven&#8217;t been sprinkled with those falling flakes in a mighty long time. Alas it&#8217;s unlikely that I&#8217;ll be dreaming of a white Tokyo. It didn&#8217;t really stick.<br />
