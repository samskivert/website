  <p>A solidly entertaining sequel to a stylish and promising original. The numerous little somethings that a game like Jak and Daxter somehow lacks, Sly provides in spades: graceful controls, a sense of humor, good voice acting, exquisite visual style, an entertaining plot. I may not leap of out my seat with applause were this a stage performance, but I wouldn&#8217;t be at all reluctant to stand while bringing my hands together in that time-honored indication of respect.</p>
