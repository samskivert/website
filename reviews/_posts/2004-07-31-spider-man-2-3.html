  <p>More so than other comics to film conversions, Spider-Man feels to me like a modern day fairy tale. Though as a properly modern tale it tempers its open moralizing with a healthy dose of moral ambiguity, and there&#8217;s no shortage of action. At least he finally worked things out with Mary Jane, to have Spidey suffer sexlessly in the name of the greater good would be downright un-American.</p>
