  <p>A fascinating trip down the rabbit hole of embryological development, genes&#8217; role in the process, and all the weird shit that can go wrong when a fork is stuck somewhere therein. The author does not set out to titillate, but as a matter of course covers some serious sideshow freakery &#8212; complete with detailed descriptions of the breakdown in the relevant developmental processes.</p>
