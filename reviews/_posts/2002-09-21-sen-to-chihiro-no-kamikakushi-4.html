  <p>Hayao Miyazaki is a creative genius. This is possibly the most enjoyable film I&#8217;ve seen in my entire life. <cite>Mononoke Hime</cite> was a great film, but dwelled more deeply in the realm of Japanese cultural legend. <cite>Sen to Chihiro</cite> draws from Japan&#8217;s rich and colorful history, but blends this with a raw humanity that makes the end result universally appealing. On top of the brilliant characters and story, the cinematography and artwork are on par with the best live action films ever produced. Do not fail to see this film and do not fail to see it on the big screen.</p>
