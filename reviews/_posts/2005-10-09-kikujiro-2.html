  <p>A deadbeat boyfriend gets saddled with taking a pesky kid way up north to find his long lost mother. The inevitable charming moments ensue and are accompanied by scenes so bizarrely campy that even Mel Brooks would think twice about putting them in a film. However, the deadbeat boyfriend was such a mean bastard that the whole schtick failed to come together.</p>
