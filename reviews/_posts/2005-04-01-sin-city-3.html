  <p>I have to admit to not having read all the graphic novels on which the film was based, but the adaptation for the screen stood well enough on its own as a fine piece of entertainment. Clearly the graphic nature of the graphic novels was preserved, it is a very visual film. It took a while for me to settle into the heavily lacquered style, but once I got my mind around it, the remainder of the film slid nicely into place, scene after scene.</p>
