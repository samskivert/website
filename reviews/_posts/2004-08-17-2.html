  <p>Alas, even Kurosawa seems to have taken to self-indulgent soap-boxery in the end. The best of the dreams were simply strange, the others unconsidered criticism of modern life or hollow nostalgia for days of yore. I can hardly believe this is the work of the same man that so keenly and vibrantly expressed the human condition through film time and time again.</p>
