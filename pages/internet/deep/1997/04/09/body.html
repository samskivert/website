     <blockquote>Everyone wants Prolog.<br>
      You're gonna love Prolog.<br>
      Come on and get Prolog, <br>
      get Prolog, get Prolog... <br>

<P>Much of programming in traditional languages consists of drudgery.
Whipping data structures to and fro, playing "hide and go memory leak",
while-ing away the nanoseconds, and specifying all sorts of algorithmic
details that serve only to annoy.  When a program's goal is simply to
harness the CPU and reach a conclusion, we
shouldn't have to waste our time holding its hand.
We would prefer simply to specify the laws of the software's universe
and let the rest take place automagically.

<P>And so it goes, in <a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/bngusenet/comp/lang/prolog/top.html" target="_blank">Prolog</a>.  "Programming in Logic" is probably
best known for its applications in artificial intelligence and
expert systems, but it's useful for all sorts of tasks.  If your
application lends itself to expression in facts and rules, the Prolog
code will be extremely concise relative to other languages.

<P>A Prolog interpreter is essentially an extremely capable theorem
prover.  Program data consists of a set of <i>facts</i> (statements asserted
to be true) and <i>rules</i> (mechanisms for logical inference.) It can then
be presented with a <i>question</i> (a proposed theorem conclusion) and the
interpreter will deduce whether it can be proven given the known facts
and rules.  The actual mechanisms by which this is done are under the
hood (but I'll eventually let you in on the secret, because I like you.)

<P>The feel is most easily communicated by example.  Let's learn about
Prolog through this crude but <a href="01.html" target="define"><b>effective</b></a><sup>1</sup> matchmaking program.  "gender"
and "likes" are the <i>relations</i> we use to express facts.  Arguments
beginning with a lowercase letter are treated as <i>constants</i> and those
beginning with an uppercase letter are <i>variables</i>.  A variable holds
the same meaning within the scope of a particular rule.


<P><tt>
<pre>/*
 * Modern dating can be so confusing!
 * Sort it out with PROLOG.
 */</pre>

<P>/* facts about gender */<br>
gender(alicia, female).<br>
gender(barbara, female).<br>
gender(cynthia, female).<br>
gender(dimh, male).<br>
gender(egbert, male).

<P>
/* facts about preferences */<br>
likes(alicia, male).<br>
likes(alicia, female).<br>
likes(barbara, female).<br>
likes(cynthia, male).<br>
likes(dimh, male).<br>
likes(dimh, female).<br>
likes(egbert, female).

<P>

  /* rule about who is destined for whom */<br>
  good_match(X, Y) :-<br>
  gender(X, A),<br>
  gender(Y, B),<br>
  likes(X, B),<br>
  likes(Y, A).<br>
  not(X = Y).
 </tt>

<P>Once this is loaded into the Prolog interpreter, we can solve the
mysteries of modern romance by asking simple questions.  At the ?-
interactive prompt, I will query "who is a good match for alicia?"
Recall that Date is identified as a variable because of its initial
capital letter.

<P>
<tt>   ?- good_match(alicia, Date).<br>
   Date = barbara ;<br>
   Date = dimh ;<br>
   Date = egbert ;<br>
   No
</tt>
<P>The interpreter goes about its work like so.  It finds no facts
that match our question (else it would have returned that fact immediately),
but it does find the rule <tt>good_match(X, Y)</tt>.  It replaces our goal
with the list of goals enumerated in the good_match rule, with the variable
<tt>X</tt> now bound to the constant <tt>alicia</tt> and the variables <tt>Y</tt> and <tt>Date</tt>
bound to one another.  Now it must satisfy all these rules.  First among
them is <tt>gender(alicia, A)</tt>.  Our database contains the fact
<tt>gender(alicia, female)</tt>, so <tt>A</tt> is bound to <tt>female</tt>.
This matching process continues until all variables are successfully
bound, or all possibilities fail, or <a href="02.html" target="define"><b>our CPU limit</b></a><sup>2</sup> is exceeded and
the system administrator comes grimly stalking us with a <a href="03.html" target="define"><b>LART</b></a><sup>3</sup>.

<P>Once it satisfies the goal, it can be told to find further possibilities
with a single semicolon.  The interpreter scratches its initials
into the spot on the parse tree where a solution is found, so it just
<a href="04.html" target="define"><b>backtracks</b></a><sup>4</sup> from there until it finds another solution.
In this example, there were eventually no dates remaining for poor
alicia, and the interpreter displayed its innate indifference toward
the lovelorn with: <tt>No.</tt>

<P>The inclusion of <tt>not(X = Y)</tt> in the good_match conditions is necessary
to keep barbara from pursuing a date with herself.  The introduction of
negation to a Prolog program has some interesting implications, because
of what is called the "closed world assumption." Prolog assumes that
everything that cannot be proven true, <a href="05.html" target="define"><b>must be false</b></a><sup>5</sup>.  So if you
asked Prolog

<P>
<tt>?- not jimmy_hoffa(buried_in_giants_stadium)</tt>

<P>it would <a href="06.html" target="define"><b>most likely</b></a><sup>6</sup> answer "yes", which seems to imply it proved
that Jimmy Hoffa is not buried in Giant's stadium.  In fact, it failed
to prove that Jimmy Hoffa IS buried in Giant's stadium -- a considerably
less controversial outcome.

<P>Because Prolog is so thorough about exploring the possibilities,
it can be <a href="07.html" target="define"><b>extremely slow</b></a><sup>7</sup>.  This difficulty is alleviated somewhat
at a cost in elegance by allowing the programmer to control
backtracking.  If a program reaches a <i>cut</i> (represented by an
exclamation point), the interpreter <a href="08.html" target="define"><b>will not attempt any further
backtracking</b></a><sup>8</sup> from that point in the program.

<P>Unfortunately cuts introduce a schism between the "procedural"
and "declarative" meanings of a Prolog program.  In code without
cuts, the order in which facts and rules are asserted will not
affect the result of a question.  Cuts which prevent the interpreter
from reaching goals it would otherwise have considered valid are
called <i>red cuts</i>, and if you need many of these, Prolog may not
have been such a good choice after all.  Cuts that only prevent
useless backtracking are used to improve efficiency; they are called
<i>green cuts</i>, and they're A-OK in my book.

<P>So there you have the basics of Prolog.  I didn't delve into
more complex data structures such as lists or the <a href="09.html" target="define"><b>nifty things</b></a><sup>9</sup>
that can be done with them, but you can read about that another
day.  Remember, Prolog interpreters can be (and certainly
have been) embedded into other applications.  So the next time all
or just some of a project sounds like a hairball logic problem,
consider whether that sound can be improved with some Prologic.

<P>Writing a (working) Prolog interpreter in Java was a little
daunting for the time I had allocated.  A few other people have
nicely pulled this off:
<a href="http://munkora.cs.mu.oz.au/%7Ewinikoff/wp/" target="_blank">here's
one</a>.  I did have some fun with
<a href="http://www.cs.albany.edu/~sreeni/JavaCC/" target="_blank">JavaCC</a>
(a wonderful tool) and
wrote a little parser (which isn't at all faithful to "real" Prolog)
that builds up all the relevant data structures
in Java.  The <a href="prolog.tar.gz">source</a> is just for you.
