  <p>I dream of the day that I&#8217;ll be able to have <em>cooperative</em> multiplayer gameplay with my friends in a game that I actually enjoy. AC2 was purdy, but the treadmill based gameplay and linear, wack-monster-centric dungeons didn&#8217;t really turn my crank. I also found it baffling that, even on my half-gig-of-memory-having machine, it would consistently start popping up &#8220;Windows is low on virtual memory&#8221; dialogs after about forty-five minutes of play.</p>
