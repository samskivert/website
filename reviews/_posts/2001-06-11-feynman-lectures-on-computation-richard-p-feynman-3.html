  <p>I started reading this book with the resolve to do all of the problems suggested by Feynman at various points along the chapters. This made it a slow and energy consuming process because the problems he suggests tend not to be simple exercises. My resolve started to break down as eight months had gone by and I was only half way through the book. This was compounded by the subject matter of the later chapters which was far closer to physics than computation. I enjoyed Feynman&#8217;s take on computer organization, computing and coding theories, in which I have some background. I struggled through his discussion of quantum computers and the wacky concept of the thermodynamics of computation. He rounds out the book with a discussion of the physics of the devices we currently (well, in the 1980s) use to build computers. That final chapter was a welcome relief from the previous two as it required less background in quantum physics. Other than <cite>A Few Easy Pieces</cite> and <cite>A Few Not So Easy Pieces</cite>, this is the only technical work of Feynman&#8217;s that I&#8217;ve read and it is a pleasure and a challenge to follow along as he sweeps intuitively through vast tracts of math, physics and logic on his way to some particularly interesting observation or other. I&#8217;m also amazed at how interested someone can be in computers and how much thinking they can do about them without actually giving any thought to what can be <em>done</em> with them. Recommended if you&#8217;re a fan of Feynman, not so much if you&#8217;re looking for novel discourse on computation.</p>
