  <p>I&#8217;m a fan of Dick&#8217;s dystopian visions of the future and Spielberg and company did an excellent job of bringing this particular vision to life. We&#8217;re living in the twenty first century now and I see films like <cite>Minority Report</cite> as an inevitable step toward our transition from memes that have their roots in the twentieth century &#8212; space travel, time travel, robots taking over the world &#8212; to more modern memes like augmented reality, nanotech and information crime. I didn&#8217;t appreciate that, once again, Hollywood has deigned to tack a happy ending onto one of Dick&#8217;s stories, but such an annoyance is easy enough to ignore in an otherwise fine film.</p>
