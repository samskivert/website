<p>A fantastic book about the Spartans and their tide turning showdown against the Persians at Thermopylae. I canâ€™t vouch for the historical accuracy, but the details of life as a Spartan were fascinating. I also recently found out this story is being turned into a film called <cite>300</cite>, based on the Frank Miller series of the same title.
