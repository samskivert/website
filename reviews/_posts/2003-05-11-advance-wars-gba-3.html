  <p>This is a damned fun game. A turn based strategy game played out with military units in bite sized scenarios that are structured enough to have their own flavor but open ended enough to give you the opportunity to develop and use your own style, all couched in a storyline that is silly, but in a good comic book sort of way rather than a badly localized RPG sort of way. I highly recommend it to anyone with GBA playtime in their schedule.</p>
