<tt>Consider implementing a Turing machine in Conway's system, then
implementing von Neumann's cellular automaton on the Turing machine and then
running the cellular automaton on von Neumann's self-replicating machine to
cause it to replicate itself. On second thought, don't consider that, it might
hurt.
