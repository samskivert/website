  <p>I&#8217;m a big fan of Akira Kurosawa&#8217;s films and <i>High and Low</i> did nothing but strengthen my convictions. Amazing shots from unlikely perspectives; a no-nonsense plot with bold, thought-provoking (if a bit cut and dry) moral issues; elegance and simplicity, yet depth. I do think that the antagonist was a bit strange, but he fit nicely in with the fifties propaganda film overtones.</p>
