  <p>High quality 2D Zelda action. The switching between scales was well conceived and well executed and the standard Zelda complement of special items were equally innovative and well done. The dungeons sizable, the difficulty level smoothly increasing, the ending suitably challenging and the Minish super cute! </p>
