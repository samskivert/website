  <p>A fantastic documentary about the musicians that were brought together to write and perform the score for the Coen Brothers&#8217; film <cite>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</cite> Anything but a group of narcissistic pop stars, these performers were the nicest group a&#8217; people y&#8217;ever could meet. Humble, funny, hardworking musicians that demonstrated a love for their music and a gratitude that others loved it too. This film warms the ears as well as the cockles.</p>
