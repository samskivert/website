  <p>Nothing about this film is particularly exceptional, yet I enjoyed it thoroughly. I somehow came to care deeply for every one of the characters, even the ones with whom I was in violent disagreement. It no doubt captures and communicates something of the essence of modern humanity, and the schtick of having a grandmother in a coma to whom many of the characters come and pour out their hearts was surprisingly effective.</p>
