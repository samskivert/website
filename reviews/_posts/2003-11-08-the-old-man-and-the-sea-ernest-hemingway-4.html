  <p>My first foray into Hemingway and I dug it the most. I sure do like that straight shootin&#8217; American literature. I was just dragging myself through a little Nietzsche and I couldn&#8217;t help but to start skimming. I can&#8217;t even make it past the first chapter of anything by Mann. Maybe it&#8217;s the short attention span.</p>
