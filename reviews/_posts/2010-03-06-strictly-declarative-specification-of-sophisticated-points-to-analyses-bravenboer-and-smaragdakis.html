title: "Strictly Declarative Specification of Sophisticated Points-to Analyses â€“ Bravenboer and Smaragdakis"
category: papers
---

<p>Describes a points-to analysis expressed entirely as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog">Datalog</a> program. (Datalog is awesome!) They focus on the optimizations done to the Datalog program to allow the analysis to be faster and more scalable than the state-of-the-art (the paper being from OOPSLA 2009). The existing techniques have moved toward using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decision_diagram">BDDs</a> to improve scalability and these guys are keen to prove that to be a bad idea.</p>
