  <p>Unless you&#8217;re extremely interested in having a look at Halle Berry&#8217;s upper half, steer clear of this film. We were trying to see <cite>With a Friend Like Harry</cite> but got to the theater so late that we were moved to switch choices at the last minute (always a dangerous proposition). It was either this or <cite>Tomb Raider</cite> and while I confess that Angelina Jolie&#8217;s upper half may eventually motivate me to see that film, at the time it seemed like <cite>Swordfish</cite> might have other redeeming qualities. It doesn&#8217;t. As expected, the dialogue was obviously written with the help of a dart board covered with words like firewall, cipher, 128-bit, hacker, SCSI, and Torvalds.</p>
