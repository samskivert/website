<p>An engaging dramatization of the beginning of Tony Blair’s long successful career and the waning relevance of Queen Elizabeth’s. I have no special interest in the English monarchy, but this account was fascinating and felt far more interesting and relevant than the sort of Dangerous Liaisons business that one generally gets in the way of portraits of royalty.
