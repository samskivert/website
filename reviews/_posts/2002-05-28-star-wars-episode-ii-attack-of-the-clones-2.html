  <p>When the audience laughed out loud at the first ostensiably &#8220;dramatic&#8221; scene, I thought to myself, &#8220;Gee, I haven&#8217;t seen something like that happen since&#8230; Oh that&#8217;s right, &#8216;The Phantom Menace&#8217;.&#8221; Lucas has yet again demonstrated his utter ignorance of character development and human drama. The &#8220;tension&#8221; between Anakin and Obi-Wan was practically rammed down our throats; the &#8220;love affair&#8221; between Anakin and Amidala parodied itself. The overarching plot was well conceived, but the translation into a screenplay was so poorly executed that, minus the special effects, it wouldn&#8217;t have garnered George a passing grade in script writing 101. Something in the process of bringing these new Star Wars films to the moviegoing public is failing horribly and I am left feeling that Mr. Lucas is, knowingly or otherwise, giving his fans the short-shrift. That said, the scene with Yoda versus Dooku did kick ass.</p>
