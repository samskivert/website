title: "Automatic!"
---

  <p>There&#8217;s simply a lot more automation going on in this country. Automatic doors abound. My toilet activates some sort of fan when I close the lid, but only if I&#8217;ve actually used it. It can tell. Even the little clock built into the bed in my hotel room detects when there&#8217;s been no motion in the room and dims its LCD display so as to provide a more soothing sleeping environment.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a piece of hardware sitting under my telephone the purpose of which I have yet to discern. Given the sophistication of the other hardware in the room, I can only assume that it is constantly monitoring my emotional well-being and would immediately notify rectifying personnel if I were to find anything to be even slightly to my dissatisfaction.</p>
