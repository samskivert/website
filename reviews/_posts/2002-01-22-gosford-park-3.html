  <p>Even though the first forty five minutes are spent nearly entirely on character introduction, you may want to make a diagram to help sort things out. I had the good fortune of seeing half of the film twice thanks to a fire drill in the middle of my first viewing. With the help of the twice over and through careful attention, my understanding of the characters&#8217; relationships and motivations was crystallizing just as the film ended. I&#8217;ll admit to exaggerating a bit, but I still could have used that diagram. In spite of the swirling mass of characters and the unforgiving British and Scottish accents, the film manages to be funny and entertaining.</p>
