  <p>This book was a goodness. Heinlein&#8217;s philosophies managed to penetrate the layer of predjudices and discarded ideologies that seem to hang so thick over most decades-old science fiction. One can taste a bit of the sixties in his noble efforts to continue the millenia-old tradition of suggesting that perhaps we could all just love one another and get along.</p>
