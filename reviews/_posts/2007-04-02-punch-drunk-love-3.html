<p>Not being an Adam Sandler fan, I didn’t see this until it was recommended to me in response to my delight with Will Ferrell’s performance in <cite>Stranger Than Fiction</cite>. I think the thinking was that this shows Sandler going a bit deeper than his standard wacky guy routine. I’ll grant him that, but I found the film painful to watch. He does an excellent angry, emotionally stunted, dysfunctional man.
