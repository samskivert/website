title: "Savage Beasts!"
---

  <p>In perusing the text of my new lease, I couldn&#8217;t help but dwell on this particular subsection:</p>
<p>3. When using Object, Borrower must not do what are written below.</p>
<ol>
<li> To produce or possess firearms, swords, explosive or ignitable substances.</li>
<li> To bring in or fix up heavy and large equipment such as a large-scaled safe.</li>
<li> To use TV, stereo set and other appliances at full blast and to play the instrument such as piano.</li>
<li> To breed animals such as savage beasts and poisonous snakes, which apparently cause troubles in the neighborhood.</li>
</ol>
<p>I guess I&#8217;ll just have to leave my good friend Chippy, the safe-cracking, Metallica loving, explosive piano juggling cheetah, back home in America.</p>
