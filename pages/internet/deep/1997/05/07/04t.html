<tt>Popularized by Microsoft's Windows 95, directory trees are designed to
assist in the mass-brainwashing of those who fail to grasp the much
simpler 'ls' command.  You've likely seen these distinctive trees,
immediately recognizable by their "+" and "-" nodes to open/close
subdirectory listings.  I invariably find myself clicking every "+" and
never returning to the "-", but perhaps my desire to clearly see all
available information is unusual.  But I digress.
