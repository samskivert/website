<p>A Rosencrantz and Guildenstern approach to a selection of episodes from the bible and Western history. Barnes overflows with cheek and audacity right up to the last chapter, when his existential steam seems to runs out. He confines eternity to prayer, sensory pleasures and sport. How such an imaginative author could fail to include imagination in his post-human utopia boggles my mind. Don’t like the Hell theme park? Build a better one!</p>
