  <p>If you look up &#8220;visually stunning&#8221; in the Movie Reviewer&#8217;s Dictionary, you&#8217;ll find this movie. On top of the mind boggling scenery (and the yaks), the viewer is treated to a moving tale of tragedy, hardship and triumph that just couldn&#8217;t be delivered outside of the context of yak herders trekking across the Himalayas.</p>
