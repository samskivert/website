I can't believe you'd be reading this column if you didn't know this,
but "white hats" are the good guys who protect systems and "black hats"
are the bad guys who break into systems.  A relativist might now say
that there are no white hats or black hats, only various shades of
gray hats, and I would be compelled to strike him with force.
