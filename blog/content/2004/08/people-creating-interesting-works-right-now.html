title: "People creating interesting works right now"

<p>I was recently thinking about how the sum total of people in history who had the
  ability to create works of art that might impact my life compares to the sum total
  of people alive today that have the ability to create works of art that might impact
  my life. I think the former is indeed a much smaller group and yet they are so much
  more well known. Thus I decided that I should do my part to spread the word about
  people that I think are achieving greatness in this very day and age.</p>

<hr/>


<p> In these trying times of information and population overload, it is
easy to fall prey to the notion that the possibility for greatness is a
relic of the past, that we are condemned to making contributions of
marginal significance and that our role models will forever be dead and
buried. Herein I make my marginal contribution toward dispelling that
notion by pointing at the works of people still very much alive, or whose
lives have overlapped my own creative adult life, and who are in my
estimation every bit as worthy of admiration and emulation as the pantheon
of dead white men generally paraded out when one speaks of greatness. We
can relate to these creators as peers and mentors rather than demi-gods
from a distant history, and in doing so, inspire ourselves to strive to
create as they have.

<p><b>Literature</b><br>

<a href="http://www.murakami.ch/main_5.html">Haruki Murakami</a> writes
novels that communicate the growing isolation of the individual in modern
society without counseling despair and without abandoning a sense of
wonder at the extraordinary possibilities of life in that same society.

<p><a href="http://www.vonnegut.com/">Kurt Vonnegut</a> was a modern day
Mark Twain, cutting right to the heart of the human experience with a wit
sharpened by a lifetime of keen observation of the world around him.

<p><b>Cognitive Science</b><br>

<a href="http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/people/homepages/hofstadter.html">Douglas
Hofstadter</a> researches the nature of human creativity with an eye
toward recreating it with a digital computer. His writing heeds no bounds
in sweeping across the realm of human knowledge. I can particularly
recommend
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%F6del,_Escher,_Bach">GÃ¶del,
Escher, Bach</a> as the most intellectually stimulating book I've read in
my entire life.

<p><b>Electronic Games</b><br>

<a href="http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> creates
games that invite your inner child out to frolic and play. His unique
games and deep understanding of the experience of play have helped the
world to comprehend and enjoy this budding art form.

<p><b>Cinema</b><br>

<a href="http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/miyazaki/">Hayao Miyazaki</a>
creates animated films that weave traditional Japanese culture with a deep
appreciation for the development of the human spirit, from wide-eyed,
magical childhood along the bumpy road of life to wide-eyed, magical
senescence.

<p><a href="http://www2.tky.3web.ne.jp/~adk/kurosawa/AKpage.html">Akira
Kurosawa</a> made films that brought the full force of big budget
filmmaking to bear on the exploration of themes usually relegated to
literature or stage. He reminds us that even in an art form so usurped by
financial interests as film, a creative vision can be guided intact
through the stormy waters of fiduciary responsibility.

<p><a href="http://www.pixar.com">Pixar</a> digitally creates animated
films that not only continually push the boundaries of a fascinating
technology, but stand on their own as excellent works of cinema.

<p class="small"> Disclaimer: some of these people, particularly those in
the film and game industries, draw upon the help of tens to hundreds of
others in the process of creating their works. Though their talent thus
lies both in having an extraordinary vision and in an ability to
communicate that vision during the creative process, the other people
involved most certainly make meaningful contributions and merit
recognition. Indeed, in some cases an organization rather than a single
creator is all that we have at which to point.</p>

<p class="small">
Another disclaimer: this is not a very diverse group of people (individuals
are all men, all white or Asian). This reflects my own personal life trajectory
and the people to whose work I have been exposed. I realize, and I hope you
do too, that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in
my philosophy, but I can only speak from my own limited life experience.
