Remember the first time you used a mouse? I do. I had just acquired my
Apple IIGS, and it came with a demo that introduced users to "the mouse,"
and let them practice using it. Turned out there's more to it than just pushing
around a hunk of plastic. There's a whole
user-interface system to be mastered.
<p>
By now, of course, the features and uses of window-based 
interfaces are second-nature to me. If I want to move a window around,
I just click the "title bar" with the left mouse button, hold it down, 
and move (or "drag") the mouse. The whole window moves, and when
I've got it where I want it, I release the mouse button.
Voila! It all seems so
easy now, we don't even realize we're
doing it, much less <i>how</i>.
<p>
We use pull-down menus, icons, scrollbars, and drag-and-drops so much that
we may forget they are merely the latest in the evolution of
popular user-interface paradigms. Someone had to think this stuff up.
Who thought of such modifications as "dimming out" unselectable
items from a menu, or cascading pull-down menus? 
<p>
Much of the original research that resulted in the windowing systems
we know and love originated at Xerox PARC, a locale surrounded by 
<a href="http://www.publishnet.com/html/june_20__1996.html" target="_blank">much lore.</a>
At <a href="01.html" target="define"><b>SIGGRAPH</b></a><sup>1</sup> 93, some
researchers at PARC
presented their latest work: the See-Through Interface. They proposed a
set of <a href="02.html" target="define"><b>widgets</b></a><sup>2</sup> that would provide a new way of working in applications.
They're called Magic Lenses(tm), and they can be
arranged on what are called <a href="03.html" target="define"><b>Toolglasses(tm)</b></a><sup>3</sup>.

This applet doesn't seem to work on Macs. I'm trying to figure out if I care.
Check back later and I may have fixed it.</font>
<P>
This introductory applet offers a few Magic Lenses that let
you view something not normally visible in the scene. It demonstrates
some simple viewing-filter lenses. A lens can behave like a viewing filter; 
it can modify the mouse or keyboard "events" that pass through it; or both.
<p>
The Toolglass is merely a way of arranging the Magic Lenses. The simplest use
might consist of one Toolglass covering the entire working area of your
<a href="04.html" target="define"><b>application</b></a><sup>4</sup>, although you could have several Toolglasses, perhaps
with groups of related lenses.  A user could tile the lenses on the
glass, next to each other, or overlap them haphazardly.  When the
Toolglass is moved, the relative positions of the lenses are
preserved. The Toolglasses cover whatever you are working on, but they
don't get in the way because they're transparent.
<p>
To move the Toolglass around, the PARC guys and gals propose a secondary
positioning and input device, such as a trackball, for your non-dominant
hand.
This sounds like it will work out well, allowing rapid, yet somewhat coarse
positioning of the individual lenses. The lenses would be big enough that
positioning them in somewhat the right location would be adequate, and the
mouse could move in for the fine-grained work within the lens.
<p>
The Magic Lens user interface is impressive.  Lenses can offer localized
views of onscreen objects with surrounding context.  A magnification lens
can be moved around on screen, and you can easily see what is around the
magnified portion, without needing a whole new window with another
small context view. 
<p>
Besides making tools that are easier to use, the Magic Lens project is
intended to reduce the time it takes to do operations. This
is a noble goal, no matter how you slice it.
<p>
In many applications, work is done in localized areas, and often the
user switches between a small subset of tools. For example, in a paint
program, you might choose a tool to pick up a color from the canvas,
then zoom into a region and paint a few carefully placed
pixels in that color. With Magic Lenses, you could overlap a color-grabbing
lens with a zoom lens, and do all your work easily and at the same time.
<p>
The other cool thing about Magic Lenses is the implementation. As a scene
passes through each lens, it can be rendered, modified or replaced by a
different
representation of the data. The code for a lens can be simple and
modular.  Combining lenses would be easy, too: just create a meta-lens
with pointers to two other lenses, each of which it calls, in turn,
for any rendering or mouse-event handling.
<p>
Combining lenses is a powerful idea. Simple functions
can be built into more complex ones. The user is
empowered to mix code to get more complicated uses than the programmer
explicitly designed!
<p>
Next week, I implement some application of my choosing with
a fairly complex set of lenses and talk about the 
use of my interfaces. Two weeks of Deep Magic on the same subject!?! Yes, I
know it's unusual,
but the topic "lens" itself to further exploration, and next week's
edition should be fairly large.  Until then, I leave you to play with
some other <a href="http://www.parc.xerox.com/istl/projects/MagicLenses/" target="_blank">applets and read the recent papers</a> written by the Magic
Lens team at Xerox.
