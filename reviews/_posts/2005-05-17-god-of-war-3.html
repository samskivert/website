  <p>For once I picked up a game just because everyone seemed to be raving about it and I actually liked it. God of War is a joy to behold, a pleasure to control, and not too painfully bad in the story department. Though I&#8217;d like one good clean shot at the game designer for putting in that goddamned knife-studded rotating column sequence.</p>
