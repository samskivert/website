  <p>Like <cite>Almost Famous</cite>, but without the rock stars and the main character is a girl; two girls actually. A sometimes thoughtful, sometimes hilarious look at coming to grips with life after high school. Very possibly worth seeing solely based on the scenes with mullet guy in the convenience store.</p>
