  <p>Brazil meets Ally McBeal (or meets Gabriel Garc&#xED;a M&#xE1;rquez if we&#8217;re tracing memes back to their source). Despite the fact that they blatantly stole the idea of those clever cats that took an unsuspecting couples&#8217; lawn gnome on a tour of the world, the film and Am&#xE9;lie are the dictionary definition of perfectly delightful. The French can be so quirky.</p>
