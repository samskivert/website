<p>I’m probably echoing half the moviegoing world in saying that this is Anderson’s best film since <cite>Rushmore</cite>, but I claim originality, if not primacy. Too frequently Anderson’s characters’ eccentricities overshadow the credibility of his drama, but in <cite>Darjeeling</cite>, he manages to deftly walk the line and create an emotionally engaging story punctuated by his charmingly bizarre humor.
