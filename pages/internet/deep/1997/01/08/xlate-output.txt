On the /first/second/third/fourth/fifth/sixth/seventh/eigth/ninth/tenth/eleventh/twelfth/ day of Christmas my true love gave to me
/twelve drummers drumming, /eleven pipers piping, /ten lords a-leaping,
/nine ladies dancing, /eight maids a-milking, /seven swans a-swimming,
/six geese a-laying, /five gold rings;
/four calling birds, /three french hens, /two turtle doves
and /a partridge in a per tree.
