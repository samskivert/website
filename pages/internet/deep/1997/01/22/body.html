<p> Computer software is a popular albeit expensive mechanism for generating
special effects in movies and TV shows.  One effect you probably
recognize despite its absence from Webster's is morphing.  In 1988
morphing was used in "Willow", and in 1989 in "The Abyss."  Then, in
1991, it was used extensively in "Terminator 2" as well as taking center
stage in Michael Jackson's video "Black and White." Today, morphing is
very commonplace, appearing even in commercials.

As an <a href="01.html" target="define"><b>inquisitive</b></a><sup><font size="-1">1</font></sup>
individual, I set out to find out how morphing
works, and to implement my own morphing software.  I did find
<a href="http://www.att.com/homes/dt/html/morph.html" target="_blank">one other morpher</a>
written in Java, and while it was fast, it lacked editing
capabilities, and was limited to three
<a href="02.html" target="define"><b>control points</b></a><sup><font size="-1">2</font></sup>. You can also
<a href="http://www.gamelan.com/find.cgi?and=morph" target="_blank">search gamelan</a> for new morphing-related entries to see what
might have shown up since this article was written. Since I originally wrote
this, an
<a href="http://web.cs.bgsu.edu/morph/morph.html" target="_blank">excellent morpher</a>
has appeared.

<P>
There are numerous commercial morphing packages that range in complexity
from two dimensional image morphers to professional quality three
dimensional model morphers. There are a few
<a href="03.html" target="define"><b>freely available morphing
packages</b></a><sup><font size="-1">3</font></sup>
for Unix on the Net, but I decided to see if I could just
figure it out for myself and write a quick-and-dirty 2D morphing
program.

<P>
Morphing is a combination of two image effects. The first is fading one
color into another, and the second is warping.  The fading seemed
simple.  I took the red, green, and blue components of a pixel before
and after the transformation and interpolated those values for each
frame.  If a certain part of the picture is red, but would be yellow
after the morph, I intended to fade from red to yellow at each step of
the morph.  It turned out that fading was somewhat more involved than
this because the warping changed the locations of the colors.  I'll
explain how I addressed that issue momentarily.

<P>
Warping is considerably more complicated.  It requires moving pieces of
the images around, compressing some areas and stretching others in order
to make the two images match up.  There are a number of ways that it
could be done, and I considered a few before selecting one that I
believed would yield good results along with being manageable to program
in a reasonable amount of time.

Originally I thought that I would allow the user to place "control
points" on the images.  These points would be used to align regions of
the two images.  For example, if the images to be morphed were two
faces, then the user would put a control point on each eye, the nose,
the mouth, and other important facial features. My software would then
move these points so that the control point on the first person's nose
would move a little each frame until the final frame, in which it would
be on the second persons nose.

<P>
That would account for the warping of the control points, but what
about the other pixels? My idea was that that they would follow the 
control points, to a certain extent.  For each pixel, the control 
points would be weighted according to their distance, and would then 
move according to these weights. For example, if there were only two 
control points, one which moved 10 pixels up and another which moved 
ten to the left, then a pixel very close to the first point might move
up 9.7 pixels, and very slightly left. A point directly between them 
at the outset would move equally in both directions.

<P>
This seemed appealing, but upon further consideration I realized that it
would not do.  Imagine many control points in a vertical row, which all
move to the left.  Now add a single control point to the right of the
vertical row, which will move right.  A pixel very near this lone
control point should intuitively move to the right, but the sheer number
of nearby leftward moving points will induce it to the left.  Clearly I
needed some kind of locality of effect.

<P>
I came up with what I call the "two-quilt" method, in which each pixel
is seen as a stretchable "patch" that starts out in a square shape, but
is then increasingly deformed as the morph progresses. These patches
taken together make up a quilt.  The user is presented with an
adjustable grid, whose points of intersection make up the control
points.  The grid is used to align features of the two images.  When
it's morphing time, the vertices of each patch on the grid are used to
control the movement for that patch of the quilt.

<P>
The two quilts are separate from the frames of the morph.  Before being
warped, the quilts look exactly like the first and second image.  When
calculating the morph, the first quilt gets progressively more warped as
the morph proceeds, while the second begins the process maximally warped
and heads back toward relative normality.  To determine how to draw the
intermediate frames, we examine each pixel and identify which patch from
each quilt is over that pixel at that moment.  Then, each quilt's color
is taken into account when calculating the color of the pixel.
Additionally, the first image has higher priority early in the morph and
the second image has higher priority later.

<P>
If your understanding of this process is patchy, don't worry, I know
this is a warped explanation, but I think this example will make
everything morph or less clear.  Focus on the second frame of the morph.
At this point the first quilt is just beginning to deform, and the
second quilt is beginning its journey very deformed.  Let's say the
first quilt has a patch of white over one pixel and the second quilt has
a large ugly patch of blue.  Since we are closer to the beginning of the
morph, we use mostly the white patch as our source color and mix in a
little blue. We color that pixel a very light blue. The next pixel might
be under a red patch on the first quilt, but it is still under the same
giant patch of blue on the second quilt. This pixel will turn out a
strong red with a hint of purple.

<P>
Enough about coloring, let's examine the warping process that actually
<table hspace=10 width=150 border=0 align=left><tr><td><hr noshade><Center><img src="diagram.gif" alt="[diagram image]"></center>
<font color="#336600">The patchwork quilt becomes warped.</font>
<hr noshade></td></table>
moves the patches around on each quilt.  Each control point must move
from its position in the before image to its position in the after
image.  Since we know how many frames we are going to be generating and
how far the control point will ultimately move, we can calculate the
amount it will change in the x and y directions for each frame. Each
control point for a given patch corner is weighted by the inverse of its
distance from the corner, and then a change in x and y is calculated for
each corner.  The rest is easy.  As we step through the morph, each
corner of each patch is adjusted a little, moving in its prescribed
direction.  The pixels, or patches, that are defined by four corners are
thus moved along, and individually deformed in different ways.

<P>
That accounts for one quilt, but what about the other one? After all, I
did call this the two quilt method.  The second quilt is going the other
way. It is made up originally of patches which coincide with the pixels
of the *second* image, and go backward, warping their way towards the
first image.  Each patch in each quilt is associated with a color -- the
color of the pixel that coincided with it in its beginning state. I
start out with a frame completely colored like the first quilt, and as
the two quilts glide over each other, I progressively blend in more
color from the second quilt.  The last frame is colored completely like
the second quilt.  Without the second quilt, the morph would look like
the first image deforming and slowly moving around as the the second
image statically faded in.

Sorry- you can't save your morph in this applet version. You may
also want to stop the other morph applet in this article (by clicking on it)

If you haven't already done so, please play around with the applet!
Because of the security restrictions placed on applets, you won't be
able to load your own pictures or save your results, but I have provided
the source code, which includes an application class that will allow you
to do both of those things.

<P>
While my morphing software may not be the highest of tech, it is cool,
and can certainly be improved upon by an interested individual with some
time on their hands. The grid could be replaced by a polygon of
arbitrary complexity, and some method of allowing the user to add
control points and connect them with lines to existing control points
could be implemented.  The calculation of how to move each pixel point
would essentially remain the same.  There are probably some
optimizations one could make to the code to make the whole process
faster.  Also, since I did come up with this algorithm on my own, there
might be a vastly superior way of doing this whole thing.  Describing it
is left as an exercise for the reader.

<P>
Irregardless of the fact that irregardless is not a word, this should
provide a good introduction and an amusing toy.
