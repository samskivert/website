  <p>Being a fan of Woody Allen, I enjoyed the comic parts of this film. The tragic parts weren&#8217;t especially tragic and were even at times comic. Given that the conceit for the film was the notion that life is simultaneously comic and tragic, I think comedy can officially be declared the big winner, at least as far as Woody Allen is concerned.</p>
