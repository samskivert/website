Fractals have become an extremely popular topic in math and computer science
in recent years. Little else in these fields quite captivates like the beauty
of regions of the Mandelbrot set or the striking realism of a fractally
generated mountain range. It turns out that concepts very similar to what we
today associate with the science of fractals were discovered quite a long time
ago. It was in 1890 that <a
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Peano.html"
target="_blank">Giuseppe Peano</a> first postulated his Peano curve, and a
year later, <a
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Hilbert.html"
target="_blank">David Hilbert</a> the Hilbert curve. However, not until the
advent of the computer have we truly been able to explore the mysterious
world of fractals. Today with the web and Java, fractals have virtually come
knocking on your door. So sit back and enjoy the show.

<P><b>Order, Chaos and Gaskets</b>

<br> The core fundaments of fractal geometry are the ideas of feedback and
iteration. The creation of most fractals involve applying some simple rule to
a set of geometric shapes or numbers and then repeating the process on the
results. This feedback loop can result in very unexpected results, given the
apparent simplicity of the rules followed for each iteration.

Waclaw Sierpinski described a procedure for generating an interesting figure
known as Sierpinski's gasket. Start with a filled-in triangle.  Locate the
mid-points of each of its three sides, and using these points along with the
three points defining the original triangle as vertices, describe four smaller
triangles, each exactly one-third the size of the original. Clear out the
center (upside-down) triangle, and you're left with the three outer

triangles arranged with their ends touching in the shape of the original
triangle. Now repeat this process for each of the smaller triangles. The
Sierpinski gasket is the set of points that are left when this process is
repeated <a href="01.html" target="define"><B>infinitely</B></a><sup>1</sup>.

<P>The interesting thing about the Sierpinski gasket is that although it may
seem sensible that we start with a triangle and end with a triangular
structure, we can in fact start with any shape at all. Instead of using the
process described above, choose an arbitrary image. Reduce its size by one
third, arrange three of these images into a triangular formation, and repeat
the process on this new composite image. Strangely enough, the Sierpinski
gasket materializes no matter how <a href="02.html"
target="define"><B>twisted</B></a><sup>2</sup> the image.

<P>The algorithms described above for generating the gasket are simple and
deterministic. One might even go as far as saying that, given a little
thought, the figures generated by those algorithms are obvious and easily
understandable. Consider for a moment then, an algorithm whose results are not
so obvious. Start with three points that make up the vertices of a
triangle. Now, choose a random point inside the triangle described by those
three points. Let's call this point the cursor. The algorithm goes as follows:
choose one of the three vertices at random and draw the point exactly half-way
between the cursor and that vertex. The point that you've just drawn becomes
the new cursor, and the algorithm is repeated.  What sort of structure is
described by this very chaotic algorithm? The answer to that is quite <a
href="03.html" target="define"><B>surprising</B></a><sup>3</sup>.

<P><b>A very impressive turtle</b>

<br> The fractals first described by Peano and Hilbert are known as
curves. The funny thing about these curves are that they aren't exactly
curvy. Most curves are smooth and have the mathematical property of being
differentiable at every point along the curve. Fractal curves are quite
different, they tend not to be differentiable at <i>any</i> point along the
curve. At high enough iterations, they do in fact begin to look curvy, but
they are still composed entirely of straight lines (for which there are no
tangents.)

To understand this, we can take a look at how one well known curve is
constructed by building what is called the "Koch island."  It is comprised of
three copies of the Koch curve on the sides of an isosceles triangle.  Each
side is a straight line.  We divide this straight line into three equal parts
and replace the center part with the top of another isosceles triangle. This
process is then repeated with all of the straight lines in the new structure.

</table>

Even though this structure starts to take on a very smooth, curvy appearance
as more and more replacements are made, we know that the construction process
involves only the replacement of straight lines with more straight lines.

<P> There are numerous curves that are constructed using this sort of a
replacement method. For each iteration, a particular figure is replaced
with a scaled down, multiplied version of itself.

The Hilbert curve is another example of this kind of fractal. It has the
interesting characteristic that in the end, it is a one-dimensional line that
completely fills a two dimensional square and never once crosses itself in the
process.

<P> Wouldn't you know it, there's more than one way to generate these
interesting curves. The biologist Aristid Lindenmayer described what are
called L-systems; the graphical interpretation of which can be used to
generate many interesting curves. The concept is simple and is essentially a
subset of that endearing language Logo, more commonly know as turtle graphics.

<P> We have a turtle who can walk around on a piece of paper either drawing a
line as he walks, or not. He understands four simple commands and executes
them according to two assumed parameters. The commands are abbreviated with
letters:

<P><tt>F</tt> - move forward one step and draw while you're moving<br>
   <tt>f</tt> - move forward a step without drawing<br>
   <tt>+</tt> - turn left by a fixed angle<br>
   <tt>-</tt> - turn right by a fixed angle<br>

<P> The two assumed parameters are the distance to travel in one step, and the
angular distance to turn.

<P> These simple rules allow us to instruct the turtle to draw a particular
figure. To actually generate fractal curves with these programs, we must go
one step further. Given a simple list of instructions for the turtle, we
define production rules to apply to that list of instructions for each
iteration of curve generation. These production rules are a set of
substitutions to make on the instruction list. When these substitutions are
made, we must scale the step distance by an amount specific to each program.

<P> Here's an example:

<P> <table><tr><td>Angle:</td><td>60 degrees</td>
           <tr><td>Instructions:</td><td>F</td>
           <tr><td>Production rules:</td><td>F ==&gt; F+F--F+F</td>
           <tr><td>Step scale:</td><td>1/3</td></table>

<P> The <a href="04.html" target="define"><B>results</B></a><sup>4</sup>
generated by our friend the turtle should be a familiar sight by now. We can
also generate the <a href="05.html" target="define"><B>Hilbert
curve</B></a><sup>5</sup> with the following program:

<P> <table><tr><td>Angle:</td><td>90 degrees</td>
           <tr><td>Abbreviations:</td><td>L == +F-F-F+</td>
           <tr><td>&#160;</td><td>R == -F+F+F-</td>
           <tr><td>Instructions:</td><td>L</td>
           <tr><td>Production rules:</td><td>L ==&gt; -LF+RFR+FL-</td>
           <tr><td>&#160;</td><td>R ==&gt; -LF+RFR+FL-</td>
           <tr><td>Step scale:</td><td>1/2</td></table>

<P> So why in the heck would a biologist develop a system that seems so
clearly suited for describing and drawing fractal curves? In this case, <a

worth 10,000 words. <a href="/internet/deep/" target="_top"><img
