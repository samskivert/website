  <p>How refreshing it was to read Feynman&#8217;s explanation of relativity after wading through Einstein&#8217;s dry coverage of the same material. Perhaps the drama didn&#8217;t come through in the translation from the German, but Feynman&#8217;s account was so much more gripping. Moreover, Feynman went far beyond simply explaining the special and general theories of relativity; he pieced them together into the larger fabric of physics and pointed out all sorts of interesting curiosities along the way. If you want a solid introduction to relativity and you have an understanding of basic physics, this is the place to get it.</p>
