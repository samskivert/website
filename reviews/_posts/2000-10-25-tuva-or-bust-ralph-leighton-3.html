  <p>I love to read about Feynman&#8217;s adventures and although these took place during the last ten years of his life, up to and including the very end, they are still infused with that authentic Feynman spirit. That he and Leighton managed to instigate a widespread interest in Tuva, a fascinating culture in its own right, and ultimately make a meaningful contribution to the appreciation of Tuvan culture in America is icing on the cake.</p>
