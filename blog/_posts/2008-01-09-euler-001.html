title: "Euler 001"
---

<p>I’ve been doing the <a href="http://www.projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> problems in <a href="http://scala-lang.org">Scala</a> both because they’re fun and as an excuse to play more with Scala and to remind myself of how much fun it is to write functional programs.</p>
<p>I figured it would be fun to post my solutions, inelegant as they may be. Anyone also doing the problems will have to avert their eyes if they see a solution to a problem they’ve not yet solved.</p>
<p>Now, on to <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=1">Problem 001</a>:</p>
<pre>
object Euler1 extends Application {
  def div3or5 (from: Int, to: Int): List[Int] = {
    for (i &lt;- List.range(from, to) if i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0) yield i
  }
  println(div3or5(0, 1000).foldLeft(0)(_+_))
}
</pre>
