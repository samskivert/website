  <p>It is something of a relief to see a film set in space that is neither related to some sucked dry franchise nor saddled with an absurd premise. Puns be pardoned, there was nothing stellar about Serenity, but it was generally enjoyable. Two things that detracted were the ignorant notion on which the plot twist hinged and the unshakable feeling that I was watching a television pilot.</p>
