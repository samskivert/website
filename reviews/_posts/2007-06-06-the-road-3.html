<p>A bleak, poetic postapocalyptic journey by father and son. Raises interesting questions of how to raise a child in a world almost entirely devoid of hope. McCarthy’s language remains astounding. Noticed that he is making the case that we should no longer use apostrophes to contract not. Cant say that I disagree. I think “Blood Meridian” remains my favorite.</p>
